_Prepared by Desiree Hensley, Associate Professor of Law and Director of the Housing Clinic at The University of Mississippi School of Law, this letter, which may be distributed to students, contextualizes the issue of fair housing in our University, local, and state communities._

Welcome to the University of Mississippi and to Oxford! We hope you are settling into your new campus home and town and will have a great first year of college. Everything is almost certainly going to go according to plan, or even better. We’re sure you will love your classes, make new friends, grow as a student and scholar, and have a fun and conflict-free academic year, especially with the University of Mississippi as your landlord. We think it’s only fair to warn you, however, that conflicts may occur when you reside on campus, and if they do you may be up the proverbial “creek.” Or, maybe not a creek, exactly, but at a place where you are without the statutory rights and protections promised to other renters and tenants in the State.

Mississippi law is not very protective of renters in general, but in most cases (not all) it does at least require a landlord to prove in court that he or she is entitled to evict a renter and always prohibits a landlord from using violence or threats to kick out a renter. What this means is that in some scenarios a landlord may change tenants’ locks or shut off their electricity but can’t threaten tenants with a weapon or beat them up while doing it. Rest assured, Ole Miss will not threaten you with a weapon. But it may be able to change your locks. (Note to self: Have you read your housing agreement with the University?)

Also, Mississippi law usually requires a landlord to maintain the rental home in a decent condition and provides a way for the tenant to get out of the lease when the landlord is not maintaining the property. Water is leaking into your room from the room above yours? The law requires your landlord to fix that. The lock on your room is broken? Call the landlord. Have mold? Landlord, please fix it. Your air conditioning is broken? Landlord on the way. Unfortunately, however, the Mississippi legal requirements that obligate a landlord to maintain a tenant’s home are difficult to enforce, and—apologies!—don’t apply to tenants like you (University students living in a dorm), so good luck getting your dorm room fixed (at least as soon as you would like). (Aside: I’m sure the University means well and will take care of your needs as soon as possible. But if not, there’s not much you can do about it.)

Mississippi law also says that a landlord must give a tenant written notice that the tenant has violated a rule in the lease, and then must wait 30 days before evicting the tenant. The reason? To give the tenant time to stop violating the lease so that the tenant can continue to live there. We know you would never violate dorm rules and are not interested in late parties, alcohol, having overnight visitors, listening to loud music, or putting signs in your windows. So, no worries there. Just in case you do violate a dorm rule, however minor, you should know that state law doesn’t require that the University give you any notice before it evicts you. (Aside: Please read your agreement about what happens if you violate the lease. Just a heads up!)

It’s no joke that college is expensive and would be unaffordable for many of you but for student loans. In Mississippi, if your rent is late the landlord can evict you just three days after providing written notice that you better pay or get out. Three days is much too short for most people to come up with the missing rent, especially when there’s no money left until the next paycheck. As a student, most of you are not getting a weekly paycheck. For many of you, your “paycheck” is your once-a-semester student loan. Imagine trying to 1) find a new place to live; 2) pack up; and 3) physically move out within three days while going to class, preparing for tests, writing papers, or taking care of a family. Three days to completely uproot your entire life is an impossible and stressful situation to be in for anyone. For students, eviction often leads to dropping out of school until the student is able to become financially stable again.

Finally, please try to avoid becoming homeless—either on campus or in Oxford. You will be removed by campus police if you sleep on campus and are not a currently enrolled student. The Oxford police will offer you the choice of either going to the Lafayette County detention center or being dropped off outside of the city limits. Interfaith Compassion Ministry has a limited number of vouchers it can provide qualified Oxonians for three nights at the Ole Miss Motel on University Avenue, but that is essentially the only resource available to you. The HUD vouchers described by Matthew Desmond in _Evicted_? There are none available here. And last year the City of Oxford chose to demolish 100 units of federally subsidized housing for Oxford citizens most in need of housing that the City could have refurbished or rebuilt with federal and state funding.

The good news is that if you do end up in a housing situation that is unfair or unjust, there is always “The Law.” Just go to the Square and hire a lawyer to force your landlord to follow the terms of the lease or the law. Just joking. This really never happens. It’s way too expensive for most renters to hire a lawyer to help them, and it’s very, very hard for a tenant to get free legal help. In Mississippi the ratio of lawyers who provide free legal services to low-income people who need these services is 1:18,000. The main local provider is North Mississippi Rural Legal Services in Oxford. You can find their 1-800 number online. The University of Mississippi School of Law also has a Low-Income Housing Clinic that educates law students by providing free legal services to UM students and the community regarding housing issues on a first-come, first served basis. You can apply for the Clinic’s legal services by calling 662-915-3493 during the academic year.

Even if you get a lawyer to help you fight an eviction, you are likely to lose. Mississippi’s court system assigns eviction matters to the Justice Court. There are over 82 separate Justice Courts in the State—at least one, sometimes two, per county. Each court has its own judge who runs the courtroom and interprets the laws differently. This is especially problematic because anyone with a high school diploma is qualified to be elected as a Justice Court judge in Mississippi. Most have no formal legal training whatsoever and regularly get the law wrong. Many have no idea about the complex personal, legal, financial, and health problems caused by the system of easy evictions that Mississippi and most other places in the United States have today. Appeals are expensive, and, in any event, just because someone appeals a Justice Court’s decision to enforce an eviction doesn’t mean that the eviction is “paused”—it isn’t.

I think you get the picture. Being a renter here at the University, in Oxford, in the United States in general, means that you are subject to forces that are, in many ways, beyond your control. Even when you have a right to be treated a certain way, enforcement of those rights is not a given and difficult, at best. Adding to the mix, being in poverty, experiencing an unexpected financial strain, suffering from physical or mental disabilities, dealing with drug or alcohol addiction, being the caregiver for rambunctious children, or even being a member of a minority group—all compound the problem. What can you do about it? Elect state representatives who will enact tenant-protective laws and reform the courts; elect federal representatives who will fund new publicly-owned, affordable housing units and HUD vouchers; elect local officials who will not demolish public housing, but who will fight to preserve and improve it. Advocate at your University for a Student Bill of Rights that protects you when you are a tenant in campus housing and when you move off campus into privately owned and managed housing. Volunteer at North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. Become an advocate. Become a lawyer.

### _A Note for Instructors_

Chapter 2 is written by University of Mississippi Associate Professor of Law Desiree Hensley, a legal scholar and tireless advocate for fair housing policies. Her “Open Letter to New Tenants” is at times provocative, informative, funny, and satirical. Professor Hensley wants our students to view themselves as tenants, perhaps for the first time, and to thereby better relate to some of the individuals profiled in Evicted. Sharing her letter would be a great way to lead students on an imaginative journey, to get them thinking critically about themselves, the book, and our collective world.

If you choose to use Hensley’s letter, remind your students that the exercise is an imaginative one. In reality, the university provides policies and rights over and above the legal minimums of Mississippi. If your first-year students have questions about campus living, they can always contact a staff member from the Department of Student Housing at (662) 915-7328. These campus housing professionals are eager to help and support students. Thankfully, as Hensley notes, our students don't have to navigate the tricky legalities of being a tenant alone. Unlike many Americans, our students have certain privileges, supports, and responsibilities. Student Housing does not simply change locks nor evict students for minor policy violations, and the Student Housing website offers information, contact channels, and a digital "Maintenance Request" form for reporting maintenance issues.

Student Housing works hard to support and advocate for students and provides living and learning environments that support student success. And, as students move beyond their first year, Ole Miss continues to provide apartments and residence hall options for sophomores, juniors, and seniors to continue their academic success and have a home away from home.

Discussing the letter with students might even be an opportunity to make sure students know whom to contact if they do have any issues or concerns with their living spaces or want to learn more about leadership and academic opportunities in campus housing.
