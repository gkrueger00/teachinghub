One of the objectives in the DWR’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is to “Support Faculty and Staff Development and Promote Teaching Excellence.” DWR course enhancement grants are available to support continuous improvement and professional development for our teaching faculty. In Spring 2020, several of the grant workshops were held online. The recordings of these workshops are available below.

**Title**: “Popculture Podcast” – A Scaled Assignment to Create Group Engagement and Focus on Vocalitics

**Description**: This three project scaled assignment focused on the efficient encoding of messages along a channel as well as prompting earlier group formation and engagement in the online environment. The students analyzed a podcast, created an individual podcast, and then lastly created a group podcast. Students were specifically instructed to pay attention to and analyze their vocalics, and they completed reflections of their performances at each step along the way to create awareness of their own speaking styles and abilities.

**Title**: Adventures in Dogfooding: Research, Recalibration, and the Writing Process

**Description**: This presentation discusses the results of a research project involving dogfooding, a recursive pedagogical practice that advocates having instructors complete their own assignments. The project involved completing the full sequence of assignments comprising the coursework in Advanced Composition. The process not only produced a current set of models, but also provided valuable insights for improving pedagogy and recalibrating instruction.

**Title**: Using Writing to Fix What’s Broken: A Rhetorical Genre Studies & Social Problem-Solving Approach to Teaching First Year Writing

**Description**: This pedagogical undertaking investigates the impact of a centralized genre knowledge curriculum where students applied understanding of ethnography as a functional disciplinary genre in the social sciences to their critical understanding of Matthew Desmond’s Evicted. Students were asked to reiterate the genre features of Desmond’s work by creating several major writing tasks which sought to foster an awareness of the real mechanisms of genre features while satisfying QEP and learning outcome demands. Students first analyzed Desmond’s Evicted, then wrote a social problem narrative which used community discourse and first-hand interviews to vocalize a chosen issue within society that concerned them; next, an I-Search paper was assigned to help students foster deeper understandings of the social problem by consulting primary, secondary, scholarly, and popular sources. Once sources were consulted, students wrote a proposal argument that used the social problem narrative and source material to introduce practical solutions to the social problem attended to throughout the course of the term. Lastly, an infographic which informs community members through visual representation of the issue and proposed solution was crafted by students. This workshop will walk you through assignment details and share student writing samples as a way to shed light on the affordances and drawbacks of the applied curriculum.

**Title**: Revising the Editing Class: Curating OER Resources to Enhance Writing 370

**Description**: In our catalog, Writing 370 is titled “Editing and Proofreading in Professional Contexts” and has historically focused on rhetorical grammar. This presentation addresses the organization of OER resources collected in pursuit of lower cost (free!) class materials that reconcile more appropriately with the course’s revised assignments, learning outcomes, and focus—all three of which will be briefly discussed. I will also suggest directions for further development of enhanced resources for Writing 370.
