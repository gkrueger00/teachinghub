Use the form below to request an online course review. All DWR online courses should be reviewed once every two years. Course reviews are completed by experienced online writing and speech faculty. We recommend that you request a review of a previous semester's iteration of the course instead of one that is currently open to students.

This form will notify the reviewer you select of your request. You should go ahead and add the reviewer as an **Instructor** to the Blackboard course being reviewed. The reviewer will contact you via email with further information. Reviews will be completed by the end of the semester in which they are requested.
