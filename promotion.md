\[expand title="Instructor Promotion Policy" tag="h3"\]

#### Titles for Instructor Track

The College of Liberal Arts policy specifies three levels for the Instructor track: Instructor, Lecturer, and Senior Lecturer. The Department of Writing and Rhetoric will follow the outline implied by this policy, e.g., Instructor of Composition and Rhetoric, Lecturer of Composition and Rhetoric, and Senior Lecturer of Composition and Rhetoric. However, in certain cases, DWR positions have more individualized variations to the title of Instructor, including “Core Instructor.” In these cases, the individualized variations will be combined with the Lecturer and Senior Lecturer nomenclature to yield: Core Instructor, Core Lecturer, and Senior Core Lecturer.

#### Appointment

Persons appointed to a 1.0 FTE Instructor positions, with a numbered line and permanent funding sources, begin accruing service counted toward time in rank at the date of hire within the Center for Writing and Rhetoric. Additionally, candidates may ask to apply years of continuous full-time service in tenure track lines from other institutions at the time of appointment, provided that the candidate, upon application, holds the position from which the tenure track service was accrued. Service in temporarily funded lines, or from full-time positions within other departments within the University, will not apply toward time in rank in DWR positions. Any requests to apply service from other positions must be awarded at the time of appointment to DWR positions or foregone. In any case, no more than three years of prior service will be applied to a DWR position.

Positions which come to the DWR through consolidation with other units within the University will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

#### Rights, Privileges, and Responsibilities

Instructional faculty are the foundation of the Center for Writing and Rhetoric. They perform the essential functions of teaching writing and speech at all levels, facilitating the teaching of writing, speech, and literacy skills in all curricula, and promoting the identity of the discipline of rhetoric and composition in the campus community. Further, they share in the decision making in almost all aspects of their jobs, including designing curricula, advising students, providing professional development of fellow teachers, conducting personnel searches, and reviewing teaching effectiveness. In keeping with CLA policy, instructional faculty do not participate in tenure and promotion decisions of professorial faculty nor the review of academic administrators.

Although instructional faculty members are not eligible for tenure, individuals holding the rank of Lecturer or Senior Lecturer cannot be terminated without a minimum of twelve month’s notice. Exceptions could be made under extraordinary circumstances as follows: 1. Financial exigencies as declared by the Board of Trustees; 2. Termination or reduction of programs, academic or administrative units as approved by the Board of Trustees; 3. Malfeasance, inefficiency or contumacious conduct; 4. For Cause.

Promotion to Lecturer or Senior Lecturer is accompanied by a permanent salary increase. The amount of salary increase is determined at the time of promotion.

#### Promotion Procedure

**Time in Rank** – The general requirement is that one should serve five years in the rank of Instructor before being considered for promotion to the rank of Lecturer, and serve six years in the rank of Lecturer before being considered for promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer. Five/six years in rank shall be defined as five/six years of service for which Instructor Activity Reports and Administrative Evaluations are available for review. The faculty member will thus be considered for promotion from instructor to lecturer during his or her sixth year of service, and the promotion will become effective at the beginning of the seventh year. Similarly, the faculty member will thus be considered for promotion to Senior Lecturer during his or her seventh year of service as Lecturer, and the promotion will become effective at the beginning of the eighth year.

When instructors or lecturers are ready for promotion, they will prepare a dossier documenting evidence of having met the requirements listed below.

**Teaching** – Teaching effectiveness shall be the principal criterion for promotion. Consequently, evidence to support a record of teaching effectiveness should be systematic, comprehensive, and thorough. A portfolio documenting this effectiveness must include the following essential elements:

- Student evaluations of all courses taught during the period of review.
- Structured classroom observations by DWR peer faculty and TDG leaders.
- Documents for each course taught, including a recent syllabus, samples of recent assignments, online resources if appropriate, and grade distributions.
- Copies of annual DWR reviews.
- Documentation of activities designed to maintain currency in the discipline and in pedagogy (see the criteria pertaining to scholarship).

**Scholarship** – Scholarship activity will be considered favorably as a part of the promotion dossier. Evidence of active scholarship would include the publication or presentation of academic papers at the local or regional level in either the discipline or in pedagogy. Instructors do have an obligation to remain informed of current scholarship in their discipline and in the scholarship of teaching in higher education. Any application for promotion must demonstrate that the applicant sustains knowledge of developments in the discipline and in the related areas of pedagogy.

**Service** – Instructors are expected to be active in service to their discipline, academic departments, the College of Liberal Arts, the University, and to their students. Such service may be documented through participation in professional organizations, departmental and university committees, advising, or other academic support activities.

#### Promotion Criteria

In order to be promoted from Instructor to Lecturer, and then Lecturer to Senior Lecturer, instructional faculty must perform duties beyond teaching alone. However, since instructional faculty do typically teach a full-time teaching load of 4/4 during the regular term, any duties beyond classroom teaching should both (1) sustain and improve classroom teaching, and (2) be defined so as to not create an overly burdensome additional workload.

Criteria for promotion include teaching, scholarship, and service. Each category of service is ranked by reviewers as either (1) adequate, (2) excellent, or (3) superior.

In order to qualify for any promotion, faculty must achieve the rank of superior in teaching, and adequate in scholarship and service. The guidelines below will serve to assist both applicants and reviewers in establishing mutual expectations. The time period under consideration is all years of service since hiring or the last promotion.

The procedure established for the review of tenure and promotion dossiers for tenure-track faculty provides a generally satisfactory model for the review of instructional faculty. Some important exceptions are as follows:

- The Dean of the Graduate School and the VC for ORSP do not participate in the review.
- The DWR review and vote will be from a panel of five full-time DWR faculty, appointed by the Chair of the DWR.
- An unsuccessful application for promotion does not prejudice later applications; in fact, evidence of addressing deficits identified by the review panel shall be considered in a positive light in subsequent applications.
- Letters from outside evaluators are not required.

**Composition of the Review Panel**

Applications promotion will be reviewed first by a review panel established by the Chair of the Center for Writing and Rhetoric, consisting of five DWR teaching faculty who, when possible, hold appointments more senior than the candidate.

**Review Schedule**

The timetable for the presentation and review of the promotion dossier shall be as follows:

- Notification to the DWR Chair of application for promotion – February 21, 2014
- Completed dossier presented to the Review Panel – March 14, 2014
- Recommendation of Review Panel presented to DWR Chair – April 4, 2014
- DWR Chair recommendation to the Dean, College of Liberal Arts – April 11, 2014
- Dean’s recommendation to the Provost – April 25, 2014
- Provost’s decision – May 9, 2014

At each stage in the process, the candidate will be notified of the recommendation or decision.

\[expand title="Tenure-Track Promotion Policy" tag="h3"\] The Department of Writing and Rhetoric (DWR) offers the following tenure policy in order to support faculty in the mission of creating original, peer-reviewed knowledge and contributing to the full range of university research, service, and governance.

Distribution of the professional responsibilities of DWR faculty is: Research 40%, Teaching 40%, and Service 20%.

### Tenure

#### Research (40%)

The research production goal of the tenure track is to achieve a national or international reputation for creating peer-reviewed original knowledge advancing the fields of Writing Studies or Speech Communication. The accomplishments which indicate satisfaction of expectations toward tenure are categorized below. Candidates may choose from the following research activities to reach 100% of the research expectation:

a. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed book published by an academic press on a topic relating to writing studies or speech communication (satisfies 100% of expectation);

b. a collaborative, peer-reviewed book published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication (a single work satisfies 40% of expectation);

c. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed, volume published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication, which candidate edits and within which candidate publishes his or her own sole-authored work (a single work satisfies 40% of expectation);

d. a collaborative, peer-reviewed, volume published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication, which candidate co-edits and within which candidate publishes his or her own sole-authored work (a single work satisfies 40% of expectation);

e. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed, journal article (from MLA-indexed) journals with a rejection rate of at least 50% (a single work satisfies 20% of expectation);

f. a collaborative, peer-reviewed, journal article from MLA-indexed journals with a rejection rate of at least 50% (a single work satisfies 10% of expectation);

g. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed chapter placed in an edited collection published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication(a single work satisfies 20% of expectation);

h. a collaborative, peer-reviewed chapter placed in an edited collection published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication(a single work satisfies 10% of expectation);

For tenure a combination of the elements above totaling 100% of workload expectation will constitute superior research.

Also important are oral presentations, including the delivery of conference papers and lectures, as well as the presentation of workshops. But in the assessment of achievement in this area quality of research and publication are the overriding criteria.

In addition, candidates for tenure must exhibit a potential for ongoing research and an established long-term commitment to research which exhibits a promise of significant publications.

The fulfillment of research expectations shall be adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the department, the members of the department already tenured, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee, with a minimum of four external letters of evaluation solicited from scholars of national repute who did not have a conflict of interest with the candidate as defined by University policy. At least two of the four external evaluators will be chosen by the chair in consultation with the other tenured faculty in the department, or members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee, and the chair will make every effort to select at least one letter from a list of four to five candidates provided by the faculty member being considered for tenure. Candidates for tenure shall provide copies of all relevant publications to the department and shall list in their tenure dossier all other relevant research activities. In the case that a work to be considered is not yet in print, a letter from an editor stating that publication is imminent shall be required.

#### Teaching (40%)

Of primary importance is the quality of one’s teaching. Good teaching is expected and inadequate performance in teaching may constitute grounds for denial of tenure. However, excellent teaching alone is insufficient for recommending tenure. Among items relating to performance which shall be considered in this area, both quantitatively and qualitatively, are the number and variety of courses taught; the direction/coordination of courses; thesis and dissertation committee work; direction of courses offered in an independent study mode; development of new/revision of existing courses/instructional materials; textbooks authored; teaching awards; and applying for and/or obtaining of grants for pedagogical improvements or program development.

The fulfillment of teaching expectations shall be adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the department and the members of the department already tenured, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee, on an inspection of the teaching portfolio component of the candidate’s tenure dossier. The chair of the department reviews student-reported, peer-reported, and self-reported data on the candidate’s teaching within the annual review portfolio during yearly review sessions. Strong candidates for tenure regularly meet courses with little or no interruption, regularly return student assignments with formative and summative feedback within approximately one week, complete mid-term and final grades in timely manner, meet promptly with students when requested, maintain recommended office hours, offer conferences with students no less than once per semester, record grade distributions which do not commonly award “A” or “F” range for the majority of students, participate in teaching portfolio process on an annual basis, receive positive annual teaching evaluations from peers and students, and document a practice of sustained reflection for teaching and demonstrate those habits and actions through a teaching portfolio presented to the chair as part of annual review.

#### Service (20%)

In this area, among the items which will be evaluated are international, national, regional, state, and local committee/task force work, workshop participation, professional evaluation of work (e.g., external review of tenure/promotion dossiers, external review of manuscripts for publication, book reviews); organizing/chairing/serving as discussant for conference panels, advising of student organizations, service on editorial boards, work as an officer in professional organizations, consulting, student advising, university and departmental recruitment, administrative work, and community service. The fulfillment of service expectations shall be adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the department and the members of the department already tenured, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee, based on information on the above activities provided in the candidate’s tenure dossier. Failure to perform adequate service may constitute cause to deny tenure; however, exceptional service alone does not constitute a sufficient basis for recommending tenure.

### Procedure

The department is responsible for informing candidates of these standards and the process for applying for tenure, for collecting and maintaining necessary materials, for selecting committee participants, and for scheduling all needed meetings. The department requires annual reviews of all faculty. Credit for prior time in service and/or accomplishments in a tenure-track position, or for other accomplishments in a field of practice, must be explicitly defined, acknowledged, and awarded in writing at the time of the offer of a position; no credits for accomplishments or time in service in other positions will be awarded after the offer of position is accepted.

Issues not explicitly addressed by this policy, including but not limited to definitions of titles, descriptions of process, and definitions rights and responsibilities of tenure track faculty, are defined elsewhere by University Policy.

This tenure policy may be amended by a successful vote of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric tenured faculty and subsequent approval by the College and University.

* * *

The Department of Writing and Rhetoric (DWR) offers the following promotion policy in order to support faculty in the mission of creating original, peer-reviewed knowledge and contributing to the full range of university research, service, and governance.

Distribution of the professional responsibilities of DWR faculty is: Research 40%, Teaching 40%, and Service 20%.

#### Promotion to Associate Professor

Candidates who satisfy departmental expectations for tenure shall also be considered promotable to associate professor.

#### Promotion to Professor

Since promotion to professor demonstrates the highest professional achievement in the University community, associate professors must show that they are mature and dedicated faculty members and demonstrate a sustained record of achievement in all three areas of the profession in order to be promoted to the rank of professor. The evaluative criteria for promotion to professor are the same as tenure, however, the promotion review committee should identify and reward work of increasingly greater impact on the field, expanding scholarly reputation and prestige, after the candidate’s promotion to associate professor. In addition, the committee should consider and reward the following categories of achievement which, while not typical for assistant professors, might be found in applicants for professor:

i. Grantmaking. Completed applications for grants related to research and/or pedagogy of writing studies or speech communication. Successful and unsuccessful proposals will satisfy this requirement, however, the review committee will be responsible for judging the potential impact on the discipline of both successful and un-successful grants.

j. Journal Editing. Service as peer-reviewer for scholarly journal focusing on writing studies or speech communication where service results in the national/international publication of at least two articles of not less than 10,000 words per calendar year.

The fulfillment of all three professional expectations shall be adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the department and the members of the department already promoted to the rank of professor, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee.

### Procedure

The department is responsible for informing candidates of these standards and the process for applying promotion, for collecting and maintaining necessary materials, for selecting committee participants, and for scheduling all needed meetings. The department requires annual reviews of all faculty. Credit for prior time in service and/or accomplishments in a tenure-track position, or for other accomplishments in a field of practice, must be explicitly defined, acknowledged, and awarded in writing at the time of the offer of a position; no credits for accomplishments or time in service in other positions will be awarded after the offer of position is accepted.

Issues not explicitly addressed by this policy, including but not limited to definitions of titles, descriptions of process, and definitions rights and responsibilities of tenure track faculty, are defined elsewhere by University Policy.

This promotion policy may be amended by a successful vote of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric tenured faculty and subsequent approval by the College and University.
