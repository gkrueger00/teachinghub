The TPEG model is developed for small groups of instructors who want to collaborate on a solution to an instructional issue and use observations to record their endeavors and outcomes. The following five-step process, inspired by the PRO-Teach and TPEG models, may be used by any instructional group, including self-declared, teaching circles, or committees.

1. **Form TPEG**: Teaching Peer Excellence Groups of three to five members form to address a specific curricular or instructional issue and create methods/materials/lessons/activities as a response or solution to the issues.
2. **Pilot Solution(s)**: Once developed, the group members pilot work(s) in their classrooms (i.e., methods, materials, lessons, activities).
3. **Observe Pilot**: Each TPEG member implementing the response/solution into the classroom will be observed by another member of the TPEG during the pilot or testing phase. The purpose of the observation will be to collect and document information, including a [teaching observation](http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/observations/f2f/tpeg/report/) and [student survey](https://olemiss.box.com/s/66di2ox3csuxfczv7eqwrn87t2lg49a1). The visiting instructor will administer the student survey, either online or at the end of the class (while the instructor of record leaves the room).
4. **Discuss Results**: After all observation(s) are complete, TPEG members summarize student survey results, discuss observations, and determine next steps. The [reflection](https://olemiss.box.com/s/uuelybkv6lhs9hl2o8jh3goap8c2641f) for this phase may be submitted with your Faculty Activity Report.
5. **Report Teacher Observation through Teaching Hub**: TPEG observations may satisfy DWR [observation requirements](http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/observations/f2f/tpeg/report/) as well, though participants are not required to submit TPEG observation reports if the observation requirement is met by other means.

The cycle may take one to three semesters to complete. For a more detailed explanation, see the [PRO/TPEG handout](https://olemiss.box.com/s/gsjxaqp8ehu8pm3re6n8pt05a0rhfd2e).
