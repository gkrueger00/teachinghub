**Discussion Questions** (adapted from _Rhode Island Center for the Book 2019 Resource Guide_, BGSU _Library Guide_, and the Random House _Common Reading Guide_)

* * *

1. Throughout the book, Hanna-Attisha references Iraqi cultural ideas and customs that influence her family. Describe the ways that her family hews to these traditional values and the ways that they don’t. How do Hanna-Attisha’s choices to embrace or reject certain cultural values shape her life?

* * *

2. How do Hanna-Attisha’s childhood experiences at school reflect the common challenges and experiences of first-generation immigrants? Does her life experience reflect the idea of America as a “mosaic” or a “melting-pot”?

* * *

3. In Chapter 7, Hanna-Attisha notes that the government’s involvement in protecting the public is relatively recent. How involved should the government (local, state, and federal) be in ensuring public health and safety, and what should be the role of individuals and community groups?

* * *

4. Marc Edwards, described on page 91 as the “warrior scientist” and a corrosion expert who helped publicize the Washington D.C. water crisis, plays a role in the Flint crisis as well. However, both Betzano and Hanna-Attisha are reluctant to work with him at first because of his “inflammatory” style. When is a confrontational and aggressive style beneficial to a cause, and when does it do more harm than good?

* * *

5. On pages 207 and 241, Hanna-Attisha explains the Arab concept of “aeb,” which means “shame.” She describes her fear of bringing shame to her family as a “tumor” that she cannot get rid of. What role do you think shame should play in a society, and are there any positive consequences to shaming other people or to fearing being shamed?

* * *

6. One of the hurdles faced by Hanna-Attisha is getting support from state and local elected officials like the mayor of Flint and Michigan congressional representatives and senators. Examine the roles played by these officials and their motives for supporting or ignoring the scientific findings about the water. Who is reluctant to publicize the findings, and why? Who supports publicizing the findings, and why? What does this suggest about the importance of public officials and the voters who elect them?

* * *

7. Even though the negative impacts of lead exposure have been apparent for hundreds of years, Hanna-Attisha’s claims about lead contamination in Flint’s water were initially denied by the government for months. What are similar instances throughout history where contamination or poisonings have been ignored? Why were they ignored instead of immediately acted upon and investigated?

* * *

8. Multiple factors influenced the ultimate lead poisoning in Flint’s tap water. How might these factors influence water quality in other cities around the country? Is this epidemic something that might continue to occur with America’s aging water infrastructure systems?

* * *

9. The Flint Water Crisis was not covered extensively in the media, beyond local outlets, until many months had passed. Why do you think that the story was not picked up by the national media?

* * *

10\. There was lead discovered in the tap water in Washington D.C. in 2001. It took three years for the problem to be addressed, just as it took much too long for the issue to be addressed in Flint. What factors influenced the delay in action? Considering that Flint and Washington D.C. are drastically different areas, what commonalities existed that resulted in similar treatment of their lead contamination?

* * *

11\. Hanna-Attisha writes, “We each have the power to fix things. We can open one another’s eyes to problems. We can work together to create a better, safer world” (13). How did Hanna-Attisha’s actions make a difference in the community of Flint? Can you think of a time in your own life when you have made other people aware of a problem that they were not aware of? What do you believe you can do as an individual to make the world a better and safer place?

* * *

12\. During her pediatric residency, Hanna-Attisha first heard the expression, “The eyes don’t see what the mind doesn’t know,” based on a quote by D. H. Lawrence. Why are pediatricians trained to look beyond what is immediately apparent? Describe a time in your own life when you learned more about a situation once you looked beyond what was visible. What action(s) did you take once you more fully understood the situation? This quote is reflected in the title of the book. What are the other meanings of the title?

* * *

13\. What are adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and toxic stresses? How can adversities like poverty, racism, and violence impact a child’s development? Are you exposed to any toxic stresses in your current, everyday environment? If you are, what can you do to counteract them? How can recognition of the lifelong impact of toxic stresses change not only how we treat adults with the consequences of toxic stresses, but also the prevention of exposure to toxic stresses?

* * *

14\. Why did Hanna-Attisha decide to teach her pediatric residents about the history of racial injustice in the United States? What examples did she share when teaching residents about the history of racism in medical care? Why did she believe it was important for her residents to be made aware of the city’s weaknesses and needs, while also fostering solidarity with and empathy for Flint’s residents? How can pediatric residents support and strengthen their communities?

* * *

15\. Hanna-Attisha describes Flint as being in a “man-made state of emergency for forty years” (128), with very high poverty rates, numerous abandoned homes, and little incoming tax revenue. How did practices like racist employment policies, housing segregation, and blockbusting disproportionately affect black families? How did government policies and deindustrialization play roles in the water crisis in Flint? Why did Hanna-Attisha choose to work in Flint? How was she inspired by the history of Flint and the roles of labor rights, workers, and strikes—especially the women’s brigade strikers—in that history?

* * *

16\. What was your reaction to the fact that, at the beginning of the water crisis, Flint residents were paying some of the highest rates for water in the country? How would this impact personal actions like the recommended practice of flushing faucets? Why does Hanna-Attisha write that, in the wake of the crisis, many Flint residents were suffering from “communitywide PTSD” (323)? What do you think she meant by this?

* * *

17\. How did the lack of corrosion control create additional problems in Flint? How did you feel when you learned General Motors switched back to Great Lakes’ water after noticing that engine parts were corroding? Why do you think the county health department did not alert medical providers or the public about the increase in cases of Legionnaires’ disease? Why do children face such a high risk of poisoning from environmental lead exposure?

* * *

18\. What complications did Hanna-Attisha and her team face as they studied the blood lead level (BLL) data of children in Flint? How was their study affected by factors like seasonality, age, and repeated exposure to lead? Why is institutional review board (IRB) approval important for a research study like this? How did Hanna-Attisha prepare for the public release of her research?

* * *

19\. Why was the data from Hurley an underestimation of exposure? Why was it important to frame population-wide lead exposure as an additional toxic stress in Flint? How can early interventions and continued advocacy mitigate toxic stress and give children with lead poisoning the best possible chance for recovery? What short- and long-term interventions did Hanna-Attisha recommend for affected children? What recommendations would you add to such a list of interventions?

* * *

20\. What is the difference between treatment of individual health and treatment of population health? How can lead exposure have drastic impacts at the population level? How does lead exposure disproportionately affect black people? Do you think it is ethical to use children as detectors of environmental contamination? What is the concept of primary prevention? What kind of policies and programs would need to be adopted to practice primary prevention? How does Hanna-Attisha’s identity as an Iraqi American woman not living in Flint influence her actions? Can you think of a time that your own identity affected how you dealt with a problem?

* * *

21\. How did Saddam Hussein’s brutal and violent rule in Iraq affect Hanna-Attisha and her family when she was growing up? How did learning about relatives like Dr. Paul Shekwana and Nuri Rufail Koutani impact Hanna-Attisha as an adult? She writes that she “understood that leaders could be dangerous, that civilizations sat on the delicate edge of a precipice, and that injustice must be challenged” (218-19). How did her Iraqi immigrant family and social justice heritage impact her thinking? How does this compare to your own thinking about government leaders? What do you think it means to challenge injustice?

* * *

22\. What is primacy? How does primacy between agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) affect situations like the Flint water crisis? How do you think state and federal governments should work together to manage environmental crises? Explain your reasoning.

* * *

23\. What is environmental justice? How does lead exposure exacerbate inequality and the racial education gap? What can residents do in their daily lives to support environmental justice?

* * *

24\. Hanna-Attisha was surprised to learn that Marc Edwards was a conservative Republican, given how much they had in common. Why did she assume that he was “a lefty activist” (235)? How might their political differences affect how they worked together? Describe a time when you have worked with someone who has different beliefs than you. What did you learn from the experience?

* * *

25\. How does Hanna-Attisha use storytelling to communicate the Flint water crisis to the public? Why did she hold up a baby bottle filled with water at her first press conference? How did Hanna-Attisha use her personality characteristics and personal strengths to her advantage? How was she inspired by Alice Hamilton’s advocacy? Describe a time that you used your individual strengths to communicate or act on a problem. Hanna-Attisha says, “I was also a scientist, an advocate, and now an activist” (266). What do you think the difference is between “advocate” and “activist”?

* * *

26\. Why was lead added to gasoline, despite most of the world’s rejection of lead due to its adverse health effects? How does the past use of lead in gasoline continue to have an impact on the environment today? Why does Hanna-Attisha refer to Dr. Charles Kettering as a “public health villain” (146)? What is Kehoe’s Paradigm (also called the Kehoe Rule)? How did it establish a new precedent that required public health advocates to prove harm before action could be taken?

* * *

27\. Hanna-Attisha describes the “real villains” in the Flint water crisis as being “the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism. These are powerful forces most of us don’t notice, and don’t want to” (14). Share your reactions to this opinion. How could the water crisis have been prevented? What policies and practices do you think should be put in place in order to prevent future crises?

* * *

28\. What are the connections between Hanna-Attisha’s stories of Iraq and those of the Flint water crisis? What is the purpose of family stories like Haji and the Birds in the narrative? Are there morality tales from your own family that you cherish and give you strength? What does Hanna-Attisha mean by, “We step over complex systems every day, walking through history and pretending darkness isn’t there” (72)?

* * *

29\. In discussion about public health pioneer John Snow, Hanna-Attisha says, “His work wasn’t about scientific discovery alone. It was about people and community. That’s what science is supposed to be about—not an academic exercise for the ivory tower, or racking up publications, grants, and offers of tenure. It’s about using the tools and technology available to make lives better, no matter what articles of faith obstruct the path” (87). Share your reaction to this. What do you think the purpose of science should be? What are the influences in science and academia that threaten that purpose? How was Hanna-Attisha’s presentation of her research before going through the peer review process a form of academic disobedience? Do you recall a time in your life where you did something that was against the norm but was the right thing to do?
