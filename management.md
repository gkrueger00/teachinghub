\[expand title="Leading a Discussion" tag="h4" id="discussion"\] Students contribute best in a classroom where they feel like their opinions matter and they will not be attacked for saying the wrong thing. You begin creating this atmosphere from the first day with the students’ own introductions. Pay attention and look them in the eye when they speak. Both large and small gestures of respect help your students know they are not anonymous and will be held accountable for speaking when appropriate. We all sometimes come up with discussion prompts on the spot due to inspiration of brilliance or failure to plan. However, having a plan with specific objectives going into the classroom increases your odds of having a successful discussion. Some of this will stem from readings you have assigned or PowerPoints you have created. In a writing class in particular, it is beneficial to direct students to the text for specific examples and evidence for what they are saying. Once you’ve determined the scope of the discussion (one essay, one skill, etc.), continue focusing the conversation before you even walk in the classroom. What topics do you want your students to discuss using that specific text? Higher-order essay organization? Quote inclusion? Potential paper topics they are interested in? Figure out at least one or two ways to ask or tell your students what you want from them – sometimes students don’t understand what you are asking of them, and thinking of ways to rephrase help you clarify to yourself what you want them to say. About halfway through the semester, I can ask my students, “What did you think about the reading?” and they will respond appropriately because they know the type of thing that is relevant to discuss in the writing classroom. I can’t ask that question on day one because they have not yet been prepped. Their answers to that question would reflect personal enjoyment rather than technical analysis. Instead, it is useful to begin the semester by teaching them terms and asking them to identify those concepts in the example text. “This is the definition of summary. Where does the author summarize?” “This is the definition of pathos. Does the author use pathos?” After mapping out what the text is doing, move on to more analytical questions. “Are you convinced by this argument? What could make it even better?” Having a plan for the day, whether you are a first-time teacher or have years of experience, will give you confidence. Students can tell your mood and reflect it back to you. Try to feel generally upbeat and encouraging. You don’t want to experience a bad hour all semester, and neither do they. You and the students are on the same team, fighting ignorance and inexperience – or at least you can be. \[/expand\]

\[expand title="Netiquette" tag="h4" id="netiquette"\] I always hand out the attached “netiquette” handout (from a former colleague, drawn from the source cited on the page) early in the semester. This lessens the number of emails I get in which students fail to address me, use proper grammar, or provide context for their questions. It’s not exactly teaching them business writing, but we are teaching writing, and they will need to write at least semi-professionally when they enter the professional world. \[/expand\]

\[expand title="Reading in Class" tag="h4"\] Sometimes you might find a short passage or essay that you want to share with the class but that was not assigned as homework. Students will read at different speeds and the time pressure might be stressful for some students. You can try to give them the time to finish or, if you don’t have the time, you can tell them it’s okay not to finish the passage. http://readtime.eu/ can give you a rough idea of estimates if you have the ability to copy and paste your text into it ahead of time. If you want your students to take notes or otherwise read carefully, allow more time.

Having students read out loud a sentence or passage out loud in class can break up the monotony a bit. Further, you want students to be confident doing such a task. However, be mindful that some students will be especially nervous about doing this activity. I tend to ask for volunteers or do short readings that go around the room. If a student stumbles over a word, you can provide a correct pronunciation if it’s a tough word but do so in a way that draws attention to the fact. If it’s a common word that is mispronounced, I would tend to let it go unless it confuses the meaning of the passage. If you have a very quiet class and no one volunteers to read, you can integrate more reading out loud activities in small groups to boost their confidence. \[/expand\]
