## Outline of DWR Strategic Plan

In Spring 2018, the Strategic Planning Task force developed 32 action items for the department's strategic plan. These action items are classified into four general goals/objectives: **Students**, **Faculty and Staff**, **Department**, and **Partnerships and Collaborations**. These objectives and action items will serve as the frame for the strategic plan being developed in Summer 2018.

## Strategic Planning Task Force

In Fall 2017, a task force was created to study the department, collect information from faculty, and eventually develop a strategic plan for the DWR. The task force was made up of DWR faculty and staff who met once a week for the duration of the Fall and Spring semesters. Between surveys and focus groups, over 90% of faculty participated in the strategic planning process.

### Timeline and Method

**11 Sep 2017**: Questionnaire sent to all individuals in DWR as Google Form​ **19 Sep 2017:** Deadline postponed to encourage more responses from individuals​ **25 Sep 2017:** 37 individual responses received; form closed​ **25 Sep 2017:** Questionnaire sent to all standing committees and teaching circles​ **31 Oct 2017:**  Questionnaire for committees and teaching circles closed.​

Over the past few months, the DWR SP Taskforce members met every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon for one-hour meetings. Ten meetings were held prior to Nov 8, 2017.

Meetings were open to all interested departmental members. DWR members attending the meetings included:  Sheena Boran, Brad Campbell, Bob Cummings, Andrew Davis, Karen Forgette, Ashley Jones-Bodie, Joanne Mitchell, Alice Myatt, Chad Russell, Glenn Schove, Colleen Thorndike, and Sarah Wilson.

During the first week, the Taskforce discussed and revised the timeline for the "Sensemaking" stage of the overall process and how this work would be used by the department moving forward after December 1.

Major discussion focused on the process for gathering departmental members’ input on mission, vision, and departmental concerns and focus. During the first week, 25% of departmental members had responded to the individual survey. The Taskforce extended the deadline and asked Glenn Schove to make a personal, e-mail request to increase the number of members responding. After the extended deadline, 37 total individual survey responses were received.

To prepare the individual responses for review, Joanne Mitchell and Chad Russell compiled the individual responses into a report with anonymous responses organized by survey questions. The summary document of survey responses totaled approximately 28 pages of content for the 11 question items covering mission, vision, issues, and strengths.

In addition to sending out an individual survey to departmental members, the Taskforce asked departmental groups to also respond to survey questions, functioning as informal focus groups. The groups included the teaching circles, the curriculum committees, the writing centers. Groups leaders were able to determine their own process for recording the group’s responses and submitting those responses to the Taskforce. Group feedback was submitted throughout the month of October. Responses from the groups were compiled into a summary document, organized by survey question. The document totaled approximately 15 pages of content.

To review and create a preliminary synthesis of the individual survey responses, the group spent multiple meetings working in pairs around the room examining individual questions for themes in the answers. Then, the pairs shared their findings with the full group and discussion focused on confirming the lists of findings as representative of the spirit and content of the individual responses. In following meetings, the group members prepared individual mission and vision statements and worked to combine them into draft mission and vision statements that reflected the focus and spirit of the survey responses. Then, Taskforce members read the compiled group responses and brought suggested changes to the draft mission and vision statements to a following meeting. The group determined that a shared progress report of the findings should be created. Bob Cummings created a synthesis of departmental issues and strengths which was reviewed by the Taskforce to confirm it reflected the spirit and content of those survey responses.

In addition to work on the departmental survey, the Taskforce spent multiple meetings reviewing proposed, basic departmental bylaws. The group read through each item included in the draft bylaws, debated individual policy statements and the merits of including each in the basic bylaws. The group’s goal was to create a basic document that could serve as an accurate reflection of current departmental practice. Any policies that seemed divisive to the group or warranted more time in discussion were moved to the appendix of the document.​

### Mission and Vision Surveys

The task force distributed sets of questions to individuals stakeholders in the department, as well as to committees and other small groups. These questions addressed the DWR's mission and vision. The task force has used faculty feedback from these surveys to draft mission and vision plans.
