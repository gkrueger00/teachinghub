The authors of this guide have assembled Blackboard sandbox courses for each of the major DWR classes currently offered online (WRIT 101, WRIT 102, and WRIT 250). These sandbox courses are not templates (so you shouldn't blindly copy them), but they offer activities, unit descriptions, assignment possibilities, and other resources that you may want to copy into your courses. We are constantly adding material to these sandbox courses, so if you have a recommendation or contribution, please contact us!

In order to get Blackboard access to the sandbox courses, please contact [Andrew Davis](mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu).

## Instructor Walk-Through Video Tours

The authors of this guide have prepared video walk-throughs of our courses to help you brainstorm for course design, activities, and assignments. Please feel free to contact any of us if you have questions about a course, or if you'd like to borrow content.
