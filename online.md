The DWR requires that all Web courses are reviewed once every three semesters. Even if a faculty member is observed teaching face-to-face, each unique web WRIT or SPCH course must have a review on file. For example, if James is teaching one section of WRIT 101 face-to-face, two sections of WRIT 250 online, and one section of WRIT 310 online, he must receive a review for WRIT 250 and a review for WRIT 310.
