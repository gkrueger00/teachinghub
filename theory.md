This section of the OWI Resource Guide is designed to give you pedagogical and theoretical perspectives from experienced UM online writing teachers. Here you will find a selection of teaching philosophy statements and advice summaries from each teacher. We have also assembled an annotated bibliography of sources related to OWI that have been influential in our own teaching.

## In Their Own Words: Excerpts from OWI Teacher Philosophy Statements

Each of the experienced online teachers who have worked on the OWI Resource Guide shared excerpts from their teaching philosophy statements related to their work online.

At times, I did not feel like I was doing a good job being their teacher, but one email changed that helpless feeling I had been living with. One of my students, one whose writing needed vast improvement for college, emailed me to thank me for my feedback on his essay. He wrote: “\[I\] have never felt so good about writing my entire life. \[T\]hank you for helping me understand it better. I wish I knew about rhetoric in high school, it\[‘\]s so helpful.” This was a student who was struggling, one that I was concerned about because he was in an online course and not doing terribly well, but he was learning. He was not afraid to try, to learn, or to solicit constructive criticism; he was becoming a writer. As his confidence grew, so did mine. I knew that I could still be an effective teacher, even if I never met my students face to face. We were a community.

This is not to say that I’ve figured this online teaching thing out, or that I now have all the answers. I still have a lot to learn about being an effective online instructor, particularly when it comes to such a subjective subject like writing. But just like my student said about his learning last semester, I feel good about my transitioning to teaching online. And this student, along with my other students last semester, helped me understand how to do my job better, how to be a teacher. I am grateful to them for helping me learn to be real in a virtual classroom. \[/expand\]

_Be available … but not too available:_

As an instructor who always wants to be available, I’ve had to learn to manage the guilt that accompanies not being “there” when a student needs help. Because online learning (at least the asynchronous kind) allows students some freedom to complete work at their leisure, many of my students, for a variety of reasons, work on their assignments late at night, when they sometimes have questions that would benefit from immediate answers. I’ve accepted that I can’t always be available when students need me, but I still struggle with guilt when I read panicky emails in the morning. I also struggle with the few cases where my availability has created “monsters.” For example, so far this semester, I’ve had 120 separate email exchanges (conversation threads, not individual emails) with one student in WRIT 250. I’m concerned that this particular student has become too reliant on constant email communication with me. Each time I check email (and I check quite frequently), I’ve received an average of two messages from her, often just a few minutes apart. I’m really struggling to convince her that she doesn’t need this constant feedback and that it would be better to produce a product and seek suggestions for revision than to try to use email to address concerns in real time as she’s working. This is not a problem I’ve solved yet; it’s not a problem I’ve ever encountered before. I know there’s a balance here that I need to strike; I’m just not sure where it lies, or even which side of it I’m on right now.

_Provide tools for success … and make sure students can access them:_

Last semester a few students expressed frustration that they only had access to what was due during the current week and asked for a full course schedule. The irony, of course, is that there was a full course schedule available to them in the Information tab on Blackboard. But because they didn’t know or remember how to find it, it may as well have not existed. I experienced a similar problem last semester with feedback on student work. I always provide detailed marginal comments on major assignments, and those comments always contain advice to students for future essays. As it turns out, though, a number of my students didn’t know how to return to their attempts in order to view my marginal comments on their essays. So again, because they couldn’t access it, all that individualized instruction may as well have not existed.

I’m still working through strategies to deal with these access issues, but one major change this semester is that I’ve posted a video tutorial that shows students how to access feedback on their essays. This has helped somewhat, but it’s clear that some students still aren’t accessing their feedback. For example, one student in WRIT 250 emailed to ask if I’d read his whole paper. When I opened his attempt in Blackboard to see what kind of feedback I had given him on the assignment, I scrolled through my marginal comments on his draft. They went all the way to the last paragraph. But because he didn’t see them, he didn’t benefit from them on the next assignment and didn’t understand his grade. I’m still struggling to determine whether issues like this one stem from the actual difficulty of accessing resources on Blackboard or from a lack of investment in the course, but my instinct says that a combination of those factors is at play here. \[/expand\]

Let students choose their goal.

At the beginning of the semester, I ask my students to select one of our course outcomes on the syllabus as their writerly goal for the semester. I ask students to explain what this goal means to them, why they chose it, and what are some of the concrete ways in which they can work on this goal in their own writing. For each of our major assignments, I ask my students to reflect on their progress towards this goal: how far have they come, and whether they need to change from one goal to another. Thus, with the ePortfolio at the end of the semester, I ask my students to take their initial goal and expand it into their reflective introduction.

This technique does more than merely centering the course on the ePortfolio: I've found that, when I ask my students to select their own goal as a writer, the course becomes less about fulfilling a requirement and more about their own writing. Small steps like this can make a student take ownership of their own work, and, hopefully, find something to take with them outside of this course—something greater than a mere grade. Small steps like this can also make the online course feel more intimate, more customized to each student's individual experience.

The principle behind this technique applies to any class regardless of format, but in online classes this technique assumes the special meaning of making a student's experience feel individual, particularly when I as an instructor take note of each student's chosen goal, and use that goal as my theme for their feedback. Thus, whenever I begin writing my summative remarks on a student's paper, I'll begin with the formula of “You chose \_\_\_\_\_ for your goal this semester, so I'll gear all my feedback towards that goal.” Giving students the sense that they have chosen their own feedback helps them take more ownership of their work.

Years ago, when online teaching and I were younger, I eschewed the opportunity to take an overload course online. Frankly, I had an attitude: the virtual classroom, I rationalized, couldn’t possibly be a viable substitute for the face-to-face experience. I relied heavily on chalk-and-talk and a large presence in the classroom; I often joked that teaching was a contact sport.

Ten years later, an old dog with nearly two decades in the profession, I’m teaching strictly online and after some reflection, I’ve decided that my mantra is, “Keep it simple.” Now that doesn’t infer a refusal to incorporate newer technology into the virtual classroom—I’m always looking for ways to make my courses more productive for my students—but I’ve found that an emphasis on simplicity in course design and presentation is essential. After several different experiments with course construction, I’ve settled on a week-by-week skeleton in which I include repeated and dependable elements. That, I suppose, is the most common translation of my mantra in practice: dependability. As I’m not “there” physically to clear up any confusion for my students every two or three days, I want my students to enter a dependable space each time they encounter a new lesson during the semester. A dependable and simple structure also reassures non-traditional students (especially older, place-bound students) who need to utilize online instruction to continue their education. Finally, an emphasis on clean, dependable course construction helps the old dog teachers like me—those still a little skeptical—go slowly and incorporate only the best of options for our students.

Full disclosure: This Fall 2015 will be my first time to fully teach online. I have used Blackboard for in-class teaching, but teaching online is challenging. I’m not only teaching online for the first time but, I am teaching Writ 250 -- a first timer. So I can only share my teaching philosophy up to this point and that involves creating my class online to Blackboard. My suggestion to future online teachers is to begin early especially if you’ve never before taught the course.

Secondly, ask other online teachers to give you access to their classes online on Blackboard. I have found this latter suggestion to be invaluable. Everyone has his or her own style and I’ve picked up pointers from all of the online teachers.

Thirdly, if you’ve used Blackboard previously for your regular in-class classes and you have a certain way you create your assignments and deliverables then do that also with your online course. You can change it next semester after you are feeling more comfortable with the whole online teaching phenomenon.

Fourthly, be precise and concise with your Blackboard course design. One of our veteran online instructors places everything under “Content” and says the more you add to your Blackboard panels the more confusing it is to the students. I am still learning this concept, and I think with practice and experience, I will improve. Precision I have learned from using Blackboard in my face-to-face classes is important. English is not the first language of many of our students, and every step you articulate on Blackboard is taken at face value. You cannot assume any point or step is obvious.

Lastly, I hope you are reading our W&R Online Best Practices Guide and that it is offering the guidance you need to navigate the online frontier.

Engaging students through multiple platforms was a revelation to me ten years ago, and the daily challenge of it has kept my teaching fresh and appealing to students’ different styles of learning. Online learning comes with its own set of obstacles in keeping students engaged, but I strive to teach a variety of texts—from online magazine articles, blogs, video advertisements, and speeches—each one showcasing a different rhetorical form. This practice of presenting information in a variety of formats appeals to students’ diverse learning styles: readings from the textbooks, short videos, still images, narrated PowerPoint lectures, links to online articles, humorous memes, and group activities using LMS tools. Though I cannot replicate my presence in the physical classroom, the online environment creates innovative avenues for interaction with students—almost all requiring some form of writing and thus requiring that students actually write more for an online class. Furthermore, my online course design allows me to offer individual feedback on several steps of the Writing Process—an invaluable practice that I could not do in the face-to-face classroom. Below I break down some of the best practices of Online Writing Instruction and show some examples of how my courses fulfill them.

1. Good practices in course design
2. Innovative use of technologies that transcend traditional classroom instruction and engage students
3. Commitment to providing a quality education to students

## How to “be there” when you aren’t there: establishing presence and ethos in the online writing class

While email does allow for instant communication in an online course, the online environment can provide other means of being “there” for students, means that go beyond the email communication of traditional face-to-face classes. Here are some techniques that we have found useful for reaching our students when they need more than a standard email:

- Apps such as Google Hangouts and Skype tend to work fairly well for conferencing with students, but we’ve had the best experience with Zoom. Zoom allows instructors to start a meeting with a student by sending that student a link to the meeting via email. Students don’t need to set up Zoom accounts; as long as the instructor has the student’s email address and an account of her own, the meeting link will work. Zoom meetings can only last about 40 minutes at a time, so this time limit allows student conferences to be more focused, and to fit more easily into busy schedules. (For more conferencing apps, see “Conferencing with Online Students” and “Office Hours” below.)
  
- During your office hours, log on to whichever conferencing app you’ve chosen. If you’ve chosen Skype or Google Hangouts, any students logged into these apps will see that you’re available. Even if they choose not to contact you during that time, your visibility sends an important message.
  
- Offer multiple conferencing apps if you can. Both Skype and Zoom, for instance, or both Google Hangouts and Zoom--and remain logged into these apps during your office hours. Some students might already have accounts with one app or another, so offering a range of meeting platforms makes it easier for students to contact you.
  
- Regardless of which conferencing app you use, it’s best to turn the camera off after the first few minutes of the meeting and go strictly with audio. This practice respects student privacy better than using both audio and video the whole time. Students often have to squeeze in their conferences with their online instructors at odd places and times: between classes, at food courts, shopping, or often in their own dorms. If a student is in a private space such as a dorm room, it’s best to respect their privacy by switching off the video after the first few minutes of the meeting. Let students know why you’re turning off the video when you do so, and briefly explain that this is your standard policy for online conferences: “I think it’s best for us just to go with audio for this conference, if that’s alright with you. It’s a bit less awkward that way.” Many students feel more comfortable with this approach, since it’s a gesture that shows that you’re aware of the awkwardness online meetings sometimes pose.
  
- If your teaching style involves posting weekly announcements, don’t simply email these announcements as text (see “Students who are MIA” below for more information on Monday announcements). Instead, try making a YouTube video of just you narrating the announcements to your students. Often, these announcements merely reiterate what students can find on their weekly schedule or in the syllabus, but having this kind of weekly reminder can help students stay on task, and help keep your face and voice in a very text-heavy environment. You can post links to your YouTube video directly in the course and email it to students. Pair your link to the YouTube announcements with a bullet-point synopsis, and use YouTube’s closed captioning feature (see “Accessibility and Universal Design” below). Pairing text with video helps keep this content accessible.
  
- If a student emails you with a persistent problem, question, or issue, invite them to set up a conference with you, and do so repeatedly. Even if students don’t take you up on this offer--and many tend not to--make it clear that they are welcome to do so. This is the equivalent of keeping your door open during office hours; it also sends the message that, within the time you’ve set aside to teach the class, students are welcome to come meet with you. Not extending this welcome repeatedly and actively can make an online instructor seem aloof and distant.
  
- And, of course, make it clear when students can’t contact you. If you tell students from the first week that you won’t be able to respond quickly or at all on weekends, most students will be understanding and respectful of this boundary. However, you might want to consider setting aside some late afternoon or evening times during the weekdays, since these times tend to be the most available for online students. Students are often taking online courses because their schedules are otherwise full. While the boundaries on your time need to be clearly stated, a little flexibility can go a long way.

  
While teaching online precludes the possibility of being physically present for most students, techniques such as those outlined above can help establish the ethos of a face-to-face instructor, while offering a scheduling flexibility that the traditional classroom might lack.
