The WRIT 100/101 Blackboard template provides a pre-developed course structure, major assignments, and grade center configuration for the standard, NYT, and NPR curriculum options. It is designed to accommodate fully-online, remote, and hybrid course modalities and is fully customizable once added to a course. The Opening Session workshop, below, provides a full walk-through of the template features. You should watch this workshop session before you decide to adopt the template.

The template is designed to save you time and headaches and to provide a consistent experience for students. If you would rather build your Blackboard shell from scratch, you're free to do so.

### Download the Package

Download the Blackboard package using the button below. The package is a .zip file, and you should not extract it. Some browsers (like Safari), may extract the .zip file automatically, so if you see an extracted folder, try downloading the package using a different browser.

[Download Blackboard Package](https://olemiss.box.com/shared/static/9m7d3sm5gzw1o1rtcnd85tpxjmn68efz.zip)

If you would like to be added to the Blackboard sandbox for the template instead of using the package, just contact [Andrew Davis](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=addavis@olemiss.edu). This is a good option if you only want to use certain parts of the template.
