## Defining Civil Discourse

[_On Being_​ ​Podcast Episodes](https://onbeing.org/post_tag/civility/) Several of these ​podcasts ​model civil discourse between people from opposing views and/or interview people with specific ideas/methods about how to practice civil discourse. See also the [Civil Conversations Project](http://www.civilconversationsproject.org/conversations/)​ from ​_On Being_.

[_Justice Talking​_ from NPR](http://www.justicetalking.org/ShowArchive.aspx) Features ​podcast episodes​ about controversial topics in which experts debate and discuss the issue (models civil, yet passionate discourse). Some of the links are older and may be broken, so anything assigned from this may need to be downloaded and hosted on a Blackboard page.

[National Institute for Civil Discourse Podcast Series](https://nicd.arizona.edu/podcasts) The University of Arizona’s National Institute for Civil Discourse hosts a ​series of podcasts​ devoted to civil discourse on a range of issues including fake news, global trade, and the role of satirical media in political debate. These podcasts run from 20 minutes to a bit more than an hour and could be used in class or as homework assignments.

[Voters Not Politicians](https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/) Voters Not Politicians is a nonpartisan coalition working to change redistricting laws in Michigan. Their movement and  ​website​ are examples of “civil discourse in action.” Students could listen to the [1A episode](https://the1a.org/shows/2018-10-08/the-state-were-in-redistricting) describing the movement and then analyze the website’s rhetoric.​

[Janus Forum Lecture Series (Brown University)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTiEffrOcz_4YIz1QvotlAPz9s8GwYa5F) This ​YouTube channel​ features lectures organized by Brown University. The event usually features two prominent thinkers or researchers who present their opposing viewpoints on an issue of concern. The dialogue between the speakers following their short lectures models civil discourse and demonstrates how the speakers tend to agree about several aspects of a problem -- perhaps more so than they disagree.

[Civil Discourse 101, from the Civic Education Video Series produced by MetroEast​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hebHUGjmcvc) A quick ​video tutorial for engaging in conversation​. The video could be used as a pre-discussion or extended group work primer in any class.

## Challenging Civil Discourse

[“​Dialogic Civility: A Narrative to Live By” by Shelley D. Lane​](http://umiss.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ufh&AN=16201256&site=ehost-live&scope=site) This ​article​ provides a blueprint for engaging a public narrative of dialogic civility.

[_The Open Mind​_ (PBS with Alexander Heffner) - Interview with Teresa Bejan](https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/free-speech/tolerating-intolerance/5717/) This ​video clip​ features Teresa Bejan discussing portions of her book ​_Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration._ Offers a counterpoint to calls for politeness and civility and a lot of really interesting history.

[“​There’s Nothing Virtuous About Finding Common Ground​” by Tayari Jones](http://time.com/5434381/tayari-jones-moral-middle-myth/) This​ op ed ​posits that arguments about moving to the middle or finding common ground aren’t inherently virtuous (e.g., where is the middle ground in arguments about slavery? Indentured servitude?). It gets at contemporary issues undergirding what civil discourse means and how part of this discussion means deciding who we want to be as individuals and as a nation.

[“​You don't have to be nice to political opponents. But you do have to talk to them.​” by Teresa Bejan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/08/you-dont-have-to-be-nice-to-political-opponents-but-you-do-have-to-talk-to-them/?utm_term=.2a846aa9cc6c) Professor and political theorist, Teresa Bejan, discusses the limits of civility in public discourse and portions of her​ book​ ​_Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration_.​ She offers a lot historical examples of uncivil discourse from figures students might be surprised to learn were rather uncivil - like Martin Luther. Here is a link to a [​scholarly forum](https://tif.ssrc.org/category/exchanges/book-blog/book-forums/mere-civility/)​ about Bejan’s book. Each response is concise and provides a specific perspective on her arguments.

“[The Real Roots of American Rage](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/charles-duhigg-american-anger/576424/): The untold story of how anger became the dominant emotion in our politics and personal lives—and what we can do about it” by Charles Duhigg

Article was published in January 2019 issue of _The Atlantic._ Based on a psychological study of a contented, suburban town, the article explains how anger is a useful communication tool, which can be used to create positive change and promote resolution in interpersonal relationships, as well as harnessed to facilitate social change. Though anger has an upside, history shows anger has also been manipulated for unethical reasons and that left unchecked, rage can create lasting, harmful effects on individuals and segments of society. Duhigg offers a way to recognize and understand anger and deescalate rage before it turns destructive.

A longer article, an intriguing **discussion or project starter for any class looking at emotion in relation to civil discourse**.

## Argument as a Basis for Civil Discourse

[“​Sustaining Arguments” from ​_The Ethical Practice of Critical Thinking_​ by Fowler](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6EyVRQe2fnkz5cFs-2_N_CGnO0kCLws/view?usp=sharing) This short ​chapter​ introduces the idea of a “sustaining argument” as the ethical obligation of a critical thinker. Fowler defines these as “​arguments which matter, about things which matter, to​ ​people who matter to each other​” (5). He goes on to identify specific features of such arguments and explains that argumentation following this model is more likely to find an audience.

[“​Reasoning and Critical Thinking​” and “​Clarifying Meaning” by Hughes and Lavery in ​​_Critical Thinking: An Introduction to the Basic Skills​_ (5th ed.)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjFYt-vk5gNYS8Gyh1bFIpfJELOAsvRS/view?usp=sharing) These ​two chapters ​are student-friendly in their length and tone. They approach critical thinking as a function of understanding argument. These chapters would be great for having students develop a vocabulary about how to evaluate and understand features of arguments and understand the principle of charity. They would pair nicely with activities related to argument dissection and reconstruction.

[“​Argument as Emergence, Rhetoric as Love​” by Jim Corder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1r0ArHgboylxuv4HRN6TSnWNXZOMbka/view?usp=sharing) This ​article​, published in​ Rhetoric Review​, addresses how people develop ​as​ narratives, and even arguments, or put another way, how to approach these narratives and arguments as who someone is. While such a sensibility might seem a bit abstract and the article is a bit dense for first-year students, I think that they can understand how the arguments that we construct are part of what makes us who we are. Working from this standpoint, the article serves as a reminder for readers/listeners to consider how identity, narrative, and argumentation are deeply intertwined, and Corder encourages readers to show care for another by using rhetoric conscientiously. This article could be used in contrast to articles that emphasize the writer or speaker’s agency as Corder focuses on the listener/reader’s agency.

[“​Transformations in a civil discourse public speaking class: Speakers' and listeners' attitude change” by Barbara​ Mae Gayle](http://umiss.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ufh&AN=13078128&site=ehost-live&scope=site) Published in ​_Communication Education_​, Gayle’s ​research​ suggests researching and presenting a speech or argument from one perspective may limit a students understanding.  A method often used in debate classes, Gayle’s research suggests students are more likely to adjust their beliefs on an issue after crafting a speech or argument from opposing views.

## Academic Freedom and Civil Discourse

[“​Academic Freedom: A Basic Guide” by James Liszka in _Start Talking: A Handbook for Engaging Difficult Dialogs in Higher Education​_ edited by Kay Landis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-gJOv6XUdtSIdDvCx4FQqS5sMW4yBai/view?usp=sharing) This ​short essay​ offers a legal history on the concept of academic freedom. It also discusses when speech is covered or not covered by the principle of academic freedom. The concluding portion of the essay discusses several case studies where free speech became an issue in a classroom or higher education setting and discusses how such cases were decided or resolved.
