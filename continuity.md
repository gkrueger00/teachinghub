As a rule, DWR classes should not be regularly canceled. However, there are unavoidable emergencies, such as instructor illness, that sometimes require classes to be cancelled. Occasionally, longer-term disruptions in the academic calendar can occur. In either case, DWR faculty should be prepared to move in-progress courses online, either in part or in their entirety. This guide provides policies, best-practices, and resources to reduce any disruption to student learning that may occur.
