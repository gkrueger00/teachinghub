:Title: Connecting… Creating a Class Blog Network for Meaningful Online Conversations
:Presenter: Colleen Thorndike
:Time: 10:00am CDT 
:Description: This presentation will discuss the benefits of using blogs and a class blog network (RSS feed) for discussion in online classes. Blogs are a great alternative to discussion boards and can cultivate an online class community. While the focus of this presentation is online classes, this strategy can also be used in hybrid and/or in-person classes.

:Title: Advancing Student Skills with Synthesis and Timed Writing
:Presenter: Alice Myatt
:Time: 10:45am CDT 
:Description: In this presentation, I review an assignment sequence that combines timed writing with synthesizing sources for a literature review. The timed writing is divided into sections that, taken in sequence, lead students to produce synthesized paragraphs that they may then incorporate into other writing assignments. One part of the workshop will offer suggestions for incorporating this approach with other units (for courses that may not have a timed writing assignment). Resources will include a shared Google Drive folder that has the timed writing unit sequence and synthesis specific resources from Excelsior OWL and other online sites.
