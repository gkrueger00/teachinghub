    :Title: Connecting… Creating a Class Blog Network for Meaningful Online Conversations
    :Presenter: Colleen Thorndike
    :Time: 10:00am CDT 
    :Description: This presentation will discuss the benefits of using blogs and a class blog network (RSS feed) for discussion in online classes.

    :Title: Advancing Student Skills with Synthesis and Timed Writing
    :Presenter: Alice Myatt
    :Time: 10:45am CDT 
    :Description: In this presentation, I review an assignment sequence that combines timed writing with synthesizing sources for a literature review. The timed writing is divided into sections that, taken in sequence, lead students to produce synthesized paragraphs that they may then incorporate into other writing assignments. One part of the workshop will offer suggestions for incorporating this approach with other units (for courses that may not have a timed writing assignment). Resources will include a shared Google Drive folder that has the timed writing unit sequence and synthesis specific resources from Excelsior OWL and other online sites.

    :Title: Starting a Conversation about a Community Literacy Center at the University of Mississippi

    :Time: 2:45pm CST 
    :Description: As Department of Writing & Rhetoric faculty members consider how to expand existing partnerships with the North Panola School District in Panola County and the Marks Project in Quitman County, among others, this presentation describes how a community literacy center could provide vital infrastructure for such work. Integral to that, this presentation opens up a conversation about the role that community literacy centers play for academic departments, their institutions, and local communities. In this presentation, I will discuss: how these centers reflect the research, teaching, and/or service missions of their home departments; how these centers are structured, including programming, services, and staffing; and how these centers impact different stakeholders

    :Title: Journaling Naked:  The Unplugged Assignment in Online Instruction
    :Presenter: Dixon Bynum
    :Time: 1:00PM CST 
    :Description: Even with the best pedagogical practices, the online classroom can often remain a limited, virtual space for students, especially so during a pandemic.  Incorporating assignments which emphasize experiential learning and reduce the use of technology (hence "naked") can help counteract this perception and aid in student reflection.  This workshop will introduce two informal writing assignments used in WRIT 101 and 102 that employed experiential learning and cover student survey reactions to those assignments.

This presentation will provide an overview of current scholarship on the role of executive function in learning at the university level.
