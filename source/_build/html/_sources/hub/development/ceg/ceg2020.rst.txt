:Title: Essay Writing at The Sentence Level
:Presenter: LaToya Faulk
:Date: April 29, 4:00 – 5:00 CDT
:Description: Utilizing Nora Bacon’s *The Well-Crafted Sentence: A Writer’s Guide to Style*, LaToya Faulk’s workshop will detail    results from two in-class activities implemented in WRIT 100 and WRIT 101 which emphasized attention to a diversity of well-conceived sentence structures in the writing process. Additional attention to voice, style, and tone—specifically as it relates to both (1) helping students establish working writing identities, and (2) analyzing the sentence structures of published writers in order to compare and closely identity a multitude of voices, styles, and tones which can then be emulated or drawn from in students’ own writing—were also implemented in the writing process as developmental strategies to improve students’ development of ideas at the sentence level. Conclusively, this workshop will outline course strategies while also provide an overview of scholarship supporting pedagogical practices that encourage attention to voice and style as elements of craft in the writing process

:Title: Making the Online Course a Welcoming Space for First-Year Writing Students
:Presenter: Marc Watkins
:Date: April 12, 1:00 – 2:00 CDT
:Description: The Course Enhancement Grant allowed Marc Watkins to explore ways to make his Writ 102 online/ hybrid course more welcoming and engaging to students. The goal was to transform the way students viewed the syllabus through open-pedagogy policies so that they no longer viewed the syllabus as a contract or “terms of service agreement” that was static and ignorable. Instead, the syllabus became a dynamic space in which students entered into conversation about their learning and were empowered to engage with more fully. Additionally, he revamped the student guide module to help students understand the transition between a traditional and online/hybrid course. Students were also invited to engage in experiential learning and developed a series of student-created tutorials and guides to help future students navigated challenges within the course.

:Title: We’re not in Kansas Anymore: Exploring Student Learning through Video Discussions
:Presenter: Dr. Alice Myatt
:Date: March 25, 1:00 – 2:00 CDT
:Description: Can a social networking tool like Flipgrid foster community-building among vulnerable student populations and thus aid success and retention in their academic work? Can video discussions increase engagement and success among notoriously underprepared Fall online WRIT 102 students? Dr. Alice Myatt’s 2020 Course Enhancement project integrated weekly video discussion assignments designed to facilitate self-efficacy, exploration, and reflection into her online WRIT 102 classes. Her workshop will highlight the successes and the challenges this project posed during a chaotic COVID semester and invite attendees to discuss ways to expand on the project in the future.

:Title: Toward an Antiracist Writing Assessment Ecology in First-Year Writing
:Presenter: Tyler Gillespie
:Date: February 11, 1:00 – 2:00 CST
:Description: Asao Inoue asserts conventional writing assessments privilege the white, middle- and upper-class students historically aligned with academic discourse. To combat inequity, Inoue says instructors should adjust “our assessment systems to favor labor over the gifts of racial habitus.” In fall 2020, Tyler Gillespie adapted Asao Inoue’s labor-based contract grading for his Writ 101 classes, and he will discuss the framework, planning, strategies, implementation, and student feedback in this presentation.
