Blackboard Templates
---------------------
The WRIT 100/101 Blackboard template provides a pre-developed course structure, major assignments, and grade center configuration for the standard, NYT, and NPR curriculum options. It is designed to accommodate face-to-face and web modalities and is fully customizable once added to a course. 

The template is designed to save you time and headaches and to provide a consistent experience for students. If you would rather build your Blackboard shell from scratch, you’re free to do so.

.. admonition:: Get the Template 

    Download the Blackboard package below. The package is a .zip file, and you should not extract it. Some browsers (like Safari), may extract the .zip file automatically, so if you see an extracted folder, try downloading the package using a different browser.

    * `Download Blackboard Package <https://olemiss.box.com/shared/static/9m7d3sm5gzw1o1rtcnd85tpxjmn68efz.zip>`_

    If you would like to be added to the Blackboard sandbox for the template instead of using the package, just contact `Andrew Davis <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=addavis@olemiss.edu>`_. This is a good option if you only want to use certain parts of the template.

Importing the Template 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Log in to your Blackboard course. Below the main course navigation, select **“Import Package/View Logs”** from the Course Management Menu. On the next screen, click the “Import Package” button.
