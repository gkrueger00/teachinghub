*Effective: July 1, 2021*

These Policies and Procedures are to be updated every year in June/July in preparation for presentation to DWR faculty and staff at the annual DWR Opening Session in August. They are required to acknowledge receiving and reading every year of employment.

New Hires whose start date is outside the normal start of the fall semester are required to acknowledge receipt of and having reviewed this document during their first week of employment.

The term “core staff” is used throughout this document. It refers to the core staff of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric (DWR) and includes the chair, assistant chair, core lecturers & instructors, writing enrichedpa curriculum instructor, instructional design and training specialist, assessment coordinator, administrative coordinator II, and communications specialist. Additionally, there are two graduate assistants who provide support to the administrative staff, answer the main phone line, and greet visitors at the departmental entrance.

Academic Advising
-------------------

Academic advising of students minoring in Professional Writing is handled by one of the core lecturers. Advising of students minoring in Digital Media Studies is done by the director of the interdisciplinary minor, who is also an associate professor of writing and rhetoric. And finally, the advising of students seeking a B.A. in Rhetoric is handled by the assistant chair.

Academic advising of English graduate students, who serve as graduate instructors within the DWR, is handled by the English Department.

Awards - Teaching and Writing
-------------------------------
Each spring semester, the Cynthia Krieser Award for Outstanding Freshman Writing is chosen and announced. At the last DWR faculty meeting of the spring semester, the Kramer Outstanding Teacher Award is presented. And at the first Writing Center staff meeting of the fall semester, the Bae McGruder Award is presented to the Outstanding Writing Consultant for the previous academic year. In the spring of 2020, the DWR Award’s Committee established a speech award and the first winner of the JoAnn Edward’s Outstanding Speech Award was announced in April of 2021.

Bulletin Boards and Digital Signage
-------------------------------------

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for maintaining the bulletin boards near the front and back entrances on the first floor of Lamar Hall.

The **communications specialist**, alongside the **assessment** **coordinator**, is responsible to keeping digital signage up and running. While the communications specialist’s main responsibility relates to design and upload of announcements, the assessment coordinator monitors the proper function of the digital signage and the hardware which supports the digital signage. The digital signage system is subject to information security controls as detailed below in that section.

Building Directories
------------------------

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for updating or having a graduate assistant update the Lamar Hall and Somerville Hall building directories. The directory should be updated at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters.

Building Mayor
-----------------

The **administrative coordinator** serves as building mayor for Lamar Hall. He/She is expected to attend all building mayor meetings as his/her schedule allows. He/She is also responsible for relaying information to Lamar Hall building occupants as recommended by UM officials conducting building mayor meetings.

Calendars
------------

The **administrative** **coordinator** schedules appointments on the department chair’s calendar. The **communications** **specialist** schedules appointments in the absence of the administrative coordinator. Both the administrative coordinator, the communications specialist, and the two graduate assistants who cover the front desk schedule appointments on the conference room reservation calendars.

The two **graduate** **assistants** are primarily responsible for booking reservations for the DWR golf cart. They also monitor the battery life and cleanliness of the golf cart.

Room reservations in Lamar Hall are primarily handled by the administrative coordinator and are only allowed after classes have been scheduled. The type of events needing rooms may include student organization meetings, movie nights, and study sessions for particular student groups on campus. On some occasions, outside organizations are allowed to use available classrooms if the purpose of the meetings promotes the mission of the university.

Core Courses and Best Practices for Teaching
---------------------------------------------

The Dept of Writing and Rhetoric administers the teaching of various Writ, Spch, and DMS courses. The core courses include Writ 100, Writ 101, Writ 102, Writ 250, and Liba 102. These core courses are taught by either lecturers, instructors, adjunct instructors, or graduate instructors. The DWR Opening Session, which is held in August, brings together both returning and new instructors to refresh them or introduce them to best practices in the teaching of Writ and Spch courses. Each year, an updated Best Practices Guide is provided to all instructors and teaching support is provided through the Teaching Hub. A full list of courses taught by the DWR can be found at https://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/courses/

DWR Events
-------------

The DWR hosts numerous events each year including, but not limited to, the DWR Opening Session, food-themed guest lecturers, webinars, and teacher development workshops. Dates for most events are usually planned one year in advance so that venues and schedules of speakers can be coordinated and reserved. The **communications specialist** is responsible for scheduling a venue, setting up the room space (including tables/chairs setup), and choosing a caterer when food is being provided. The **administrative coordinator** works closely with the **communications specialist** to provide support for large events such as the DWR Opening Session.

At the request of the **communications specialist,** the **instructional design and training specialist** is responsible for reserving and setting up equipment for DWR events.

Event Planning
------------------

The **department chair** and the **communications specialist** are responsible for event planning. The **communications specialist** is responsible for entering all DWR courses into SAP and communicating with the Registrar when changes are made after the event planning deadline.

Employee Recruitment
----------------------

It is the responsibility of the **administrative coordinator** to assist DWR search committee chairs in executing paperwork to initiate searches for new employees. He/She utilizes the ConnectU recruitment program which collects applications, automatically qualifies or disqualifies candidates, moves candidates through the interview process, and finally moves candidates into a successful or failed hire.

https://connectu.olemiss.edu

The **administrative coordinator** and **communications specialist** schedule interviews, make hotel reservations, and creates schedules for campus visits. The administrative coordinator initiates Request for Payment paperwork to reimburse candidates for travel expenses after campus visits. The administrative coordinator is also responsible for processing moving expense stipends based on the amount approved by the Director, keeping in mind how much the Provost’s Office will cover.

Employee Terminations - Temporary & Permanent
----------------------------------------------

As DWR temporary and permanent employees are terminated from or transferred within the University, the **administrative coordinator** is responsible for completing the appropriate e-form as soon as possible and preferably before the person’s last day of employment to allow ample time for the exit process. It is the responsibility of the administrative coordinator to incorporate calendar reminders in his/her system to ensure that employee terminations or transfers are handled correctly and timely. By the last day of employment, an employee exit interview must be completed by the person’s supervisor so that all UM property including, but not limited to parking hang tags, building/office keys, and computers, laptops, and printers can be returned. The Employee Exit Checklist form must be completed and signed by both the employee who is leaving and their supervisor. This checklist can be found on the Human Resources website or using the following link:

https://hr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/EmployeeExitChecklist.pdf

For those faculty who teach online and do not commute to the Oxford campus because of distances exceeding 50 miles, the Employee Exit Interview will be conducted via Zoom or over the phone and all UM property, excluding Procurement Cards, which has been in their possession may be returned through the U.S. Postal System or other reputable carrier such as UPS or Fed Ex. Procurement Cards must be returned directly to the Office of Procurement Services, 148 Jeanette Phillips Drive, University, MS 38677-1848 via Registered Mail, signed receipt required.

Since the Employee Exit Checklist requires that any loaned equipment be returned to the DWR, passwords are reset and the **assessment coordinator** moves files from the machine(s) and into the cloud. The user account is closed and a new one created if/when another DWR employee is assigned the same piece of equipment. The original Employee Exit Checklist is sent to Human Resources with a copy maintained in DWR personnel files.

In addition to the completing the appropriate e-form, the Employee Exit Checklist, and the exit interview, the **administrative coordinator** is also responsible for completing the Online Separation Notification Form, which can be found at https://hr.olemiss.edu/separation-of-employment/

Employee Terminations - Student Workers
-----------------------------------------

Supervisors of student workers, undergraduate and graduate, are required to complete Student Employee Exit Checklists so that keys, equipment, and/or any other UM property can be returned. These forms are to be completed by the supervisor indicated in the chart below no later than the student worker’s last day of employment. E-form 18s, for undergraduate student workers, or e-form 3s, for graduate student workers paid by stipend, must be generated by the e-form generator indicated below.

Facilities Management (FM)
----------------------------

As building mayor, the **administrative coordinator** is the first point of contact for building staff needing to report repairs or improvements in Lamar Hall. He/She must submit notifications within SAP to the FM for attention. In the absence of the administrative coordinator, the **communications specialist** may submit notifications to FM. All notifications are logged on a central file accessible to both the administrative coordinator and the communications specialist so either of them will have access to all notifications should any of them require further action.

Financials
--------------

Cash Receipting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **communications specialist** receives the funds that come in and immediately writes a receipt using the official University receipt book. The white copy is given to person making the payment. The pink copy is the permanent record that stays in the receipt book. Any cash or checks are kept in a locked desk drawer.

After $100 worth of payments have been collected, or at least once a week, the **administrative coordinator** will prepare the cash report for the deposit. The funds will be verified by the **communications specialist**. The **department chair** will approve the cash report before it is sent to the Bursar’s office. After the deposit receipt is received from the Bursar, it is stapled to the DWR copy of the cash report, along with copies of the receipt(s) from the University receipt book. Any correspondence accompanying the payment will be stapled to the cash report.

Procurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All purchases exceeding $500 must be approved in writing (email) by the **department chair** prior to the **administrative coordinator** or **communications specialist** processing a purchase requisition or paying for commodities/equipment/memberships using the departmental procurement card. Once purchases are made, proper invoices/receipts are retained in the records of the administrative coordinator.

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for creating all purchase requisitions. He/She will provide copies of quotes and invoices to Procurement as needed and is responsible for filing quotes and invoices relating to purchase requisitions. He/She is also responsible for returning equipment if the equipment is determined to be damaged or is different from what was ordered.

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for safeguarding the procurement card, which is kept in a locked drawer. Both the administrative coordinator and the Communications Specialist, as a backup person, have access to the key to gain access to the drawer. The procurement card must be signed-out and returned with the accompanying itemized receipt and no sales tax charged. The sign-in/out sheet, maintained by the administrative coordinator, must contain the date, person receiving the card, date returned, and item purchased. If recent purchases have been made, weekly procurement card statements are received by the administrative coordinator. These statements are reconciled and submitted to Procurement within two weeks. After reconciliation, the procurement card statement and receipts are filed by the administrative coordinator in the Procurement Card binder.

Purchasing Notification Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Purchasing Notification Reports (PNR’s) are reviewed by the **department chair** and the **administrative coordinator.** These PNRs are reviewed for accuracy and then filed electronically in the administrative coordinator’s email.

Electronic Forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Electronic Forms relating to e-forms created by the **administrative coordinator** are received by the administrative coordinator and the department chair as they are approved. Electronic forms of this type fall into the categories of: Form 1’s (hiring), Form 3’s (making changes to employment status), Form 7’s (Students Paid on Salaried Basis), Form 18’s (student employment) and Form 40’s (additional pay). These forms are reviewed by the administrative coordinator and filed electronically on his/her computer.

Other Expenses and Filing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All expenditure files, including Requests for Payment, transfer documents, moving expense forms, procurement card files, and travel documents are retained in the office of the **administrative coordinator** or archived. For expenditures **not** processed through Procurement Services, (e.g. Aramark) backup documents, including the stated business purpose and name of attendees, must be retained in the office of the administrative coordinator or archived. If the business purpose is not included on the invoice, the administrative coordinator is responsible for attaching appropriate documentation or notating the purpose on the invoice. All supporting documentation related to expenditures not processed through Procurement Services, such as Aramark, is retained within the department for seven (7) years.

Reconciliation of Account Balances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for performing monthly reconciliations by generating monthly university budget reports, identifying each expense, and comparing to request for payments, transfer documents, travel documents and procurement card statements. He/She is also responsible for researching work orders to insure they match requests made using physical plant notifications. The review of monthly expenses takes place by the end of the month following the month being reconciled. An exception is the reconciliation of June expenses. Since June 30 is the end of the fiscal year, that month is reconciled by the end of August. Any errors detected during the reconciliation are to be immediately investigated and corrected. The **department chair** will review, sign, date, and return the documentation to the Administrative Coordinator to be filed for audit purposes. The Administrative Coordinator also serves as the signatory officer.

Graduate Assistants
---------------------

Two graduate assistants are chosen each fall and spring through a search using the UM’s hiring system, ConnectU. The positions are advertised on the UM Student Employment website and a diverse search committee is formed to conduct the search. These searches are normally chaired by the **administrative coordinator.** These graduate students are hired as administrative assistants and they provide clerical support to the DWR. Their training and supervision is carried out by the **administrative coordinator**.

Information Security Controls
-------------------------------
**Writing and Rhetoric 2021-UM-009**

Servers
~~~~~~~~~~

At present, the department maintains four QNAP-brand NAS servers to support onsite backup of mission-critical administrator computers. Three of these units, designated dwrstorage02.cwr.olemiss.edu, dwrstorage03.cwr.olemiss.edu, and dwrpool04.cwr.olemiss.edu are housed in office B23 of Lamar Hall. 02 and 04 support LAN-based Time Machine backups of department administrators’ computers which are running macOS, while 03 supports various LAN-based backup and document history modes of department administrators’ computers which are running Windows 10. All three of these servers are backed up daily in bulk to the WAN-based fourth server, dwrarchive06.cwr.olemiss.edu, which is located across campus in the Data Center.

As they host file-level backups of administrators' computers, these servers are assumed to contain sensitive data on students and employees and are registered as such with IT. Accordingly, all four are all password-protected and access-restricted to the specific reserved IP address range of the department’s dedicated wired subnet at 130.74.44.xxx/25, plus the specific individual Cisco VPN IP addresses assigned to the assessment coordinator, the instructional designer, and the communications specialist for off-campus access by those employees specifically to facilitate remote management as needed.

In addition to the computer-supporting backup servers, the department maintains a dedicated QNAP-brand NAS server to support the in-classroom recording technology installed in Lamar Hall room 413, designated dwrmulti09.cwr.olemiss.edu and also physically located in office B23. This server contains local copies of student speech deliveries recorded in the aforementioned classroom, and as such, is subject to FERPA considerations due to the enrollment information a video recording can incidentally contain. This system is therefore also registered, password-protected, and IP-address-restricted, as above. The recordings stored on this system are backed up to non-public folders on Google Drive for assessment purposes. Those folders are only shared with the relevant instructors engaged in assessment or grading activity.

Lastly, the department maintains a Linux-based server on an Intel box in office B22 to support the digital signage installed throughout in Lamar Hall as well as various other public-facing academic projects: dwrweb08.cwr.olemiss.edu. This server contains no sensitive information, but is password-protected and IP-address-restricted for good measure anyway.

The department has an annual contract with CampusPress to deploy and support that vendor’s managed WordPress installation for education, Edublogs, at the remote-hosted, SSO-integrated domain edblogs.olemiss.edu. As part of the original RFP, the vendor certifies this system as being FERPA-compliant. This system is used by students (and increasing numbers of faculty) for building websites as part of coursework (or professional activities). Privacy settings and access control for student websites under this system are configured for non-public availability by default, and require permission of both the student and the instructor before content may be made public.

Cloud Storage Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All official departmental electronic records not kept exclusively in SAP or email are stored permanently in Box. This specifically includes records containing sensitive information. Access permissions to various parts of the relevant folder hierarchies are reviewed at least annually, and upon employment status changes of any department personnel who would need access to such files. Box is also widely used throughout the department for individual or collaborative storage of, and access to, non-sensitive files of various kinds.

Previously, some of the department official records material was stored in Google Drive. Although migration of department files to Box is complete, some faculty and staff are continuing to use Google Drive for other professional and personal purposes, both individually and collaboratively.

In addition, faculty and staff are using other cloud storage such as Dropbox or OneDrive for similar non-administrative purposes and in similar manner.

Information Security Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each year in August, the week before classes begin, the DWR holds an orientation session, also known as the DWR Opening Session. All returning and new instructors and staff attend the Opening Session to stay up to date on important policies and procedures as well as to help prepare (instructors) for teaching. A key component of this event is to remind everyone of best practices when handling confidential and sensitive information. An announcement will be made at the event advising everyone to check their email for an information security video. Each person in the DWR will be expected to watch and acknowledge watching the entire video. Their electronic acknowledgement will be saved in DWR files and the process will be repeated annually at the DWR Opening Session.

Annual training about the department’s backup policy will also be offered to all members of the department at the DWR Opening session.

Additionally, training will be provided for all new hires during the year through one-on-one meetings, workshops, pre-recorded webinars, and online tutorials to ensure all DWR employees are informed on how to protect confidential and sensitive information.

Sensitive Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sensitive data stored on backup or production servers is secured via password-protected, limited-access accounts on those servers in configurations that meet security guidelines set by Telecommunications/Networking, which remotely inspects the access security of those servers monthly. All onsite servers operated by the DWR are physically secured either behind lockable office doors, or by locked security cables affixed to parts of the building infrastructure, or both.

Security Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DWR employees are informed of the importance of creating user accounts and passwords to gain access to their computers. Instructor computers should not contain confidential information other than student papers and grades.

Each Windows-based computer maintained by the DWR has anti-virus software installed on it, as do Mac computers.

Long Distance Calls
----------------------

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for circulating the department’s monthly long distance report to all DWR employees who have incurred long distance calls on the department’s behalf. Each employee with long distance calls reviews the report and replies by email with their approval or with any disputes. Email confirmations are saved by the administrative coordinator. After employees have reviewed and approved their call reports, the administrative coordinate reviews the document, adds his/her footer with name and date, and forwards the document by email to the department chair. The department chair then reviews and replies by email if he/she has any questions. If he/she approves, that response is saved in the administrative coordinator’s email.

.. admonition:: Related Policies

    `Long Distance Authorization Codes <https://secure4.olemiss.edu/umpolicyopen/ShowDetails.jsp?istatPara=1&policyObjidPara=10643077>`_

Mailboxes for Instructors
----------------------------

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for establishing mailboxes for staff and instructors in Lamar Hall and Somerville Hall. In mid-August, new adjunct instructors and other new instructors’ names are added at the end of the mailboxes; alphabetizing and name removals do not take place until the semester has gotten underway due to the high chance of continuous changes (additions/deletions). Two weeks into the fall semester, the administrative coordinator asks one of the graduate assistants to reorganize the mailboxes by removing employees who have been terminated or transferred and notifying them that the DWR is holding their mail. The graduate assistant then alphabetizes the mailboxes after new hires are firmly in place.

Payroll Process
----------------

Compensatory Time Balances and Overtime Pay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compensatory time balances and overtime must be recorded on timesheets in accordance with university policy. Compensatory time and overtime must be approved before worked. The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for accurate record keeping; the **department chair** approves all compensatory and over-time requests.

.. admonition:: Related Policies

Hours Worked
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Student workers and non-exempt, hourly employees must sign-in/out each day to record time worked. The sign-in/out sheets must be totaled each pay period and attached to the employee’s timesheet. The sign-in/out sheets should be compared to the timesheets prior to entry into SAP. The sign-in/out sheets of student workers who work in Suite B, 3\ :sup:`rd` Floor, Lamar Hall are retained by the **administrative coordinator.** The sign-in/out sheets of writing center and speaking center student workers are retained by their respective center directors.

Leave
~~~~~~~~~~

All employees must request and obtain approval in advance from their supervisor before taking personal days. It is important that employees provide advance notice so their supervisor knows that the absence is not unexpected or unplanned.

All exempt employees must report leave time in compliance with university policy; this includes 9-month faculty reporting sick leave. “First Day Illness” must be used for the first eight (8) hours of an illness (other than by 9-month faculty).

Timesheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of a pay period, each non-exempt employee and student employees must complete and sign his/her timesheet. Once timesheets have been approved by either the student worker’s supervisor or the department chair, the **communications specialist** will review and enter hours into SAP. Then, either the department chair or the administrative coordinator will approve the time in SAP. If timesheets cannot be entered into SAP, the original copies are to be delivered to Human Resources before 12:00 Noon on the payroll entry date. A copy is retained in the DWR payroll files.

Absences for exempt employees are entered by the employee in MyOlemiss. After submitting the hours for approval, the **department chair** will approve them in MyOlemiss.

Timesheets are maintained within the department for a minimum of seven (7) years for all employees. They are retained by the **administrative coordinator.**

Performance Evaluations
-------------------------

The **department chair** is responsible for conducting annual performance evaluations of staff and faculty within the DWR. Evaluations are conducted according to University protocol.

Property Management
---------------------

Copy Machine and Toner Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With regard to DWR copiers in Suite B/Lamar Hall, Somerville Hall, and Suite C/Lamar Hall, the **administrative coordinator** is responsible for renewing/negotiating annual maintenance contracts, reviewing monthly/annual charges, checking copier totals at the end of fall/spring semesters and year end, and charging other departments for non-DWR usage. The **administrative coordinator** is also responsible for ordering toner, staples, and copy paper (must be state contract pricing and purchased with the procurement card) used in the copy machines. However, the communications specialist can also handle these requests in the absence of the administrative coordinator. User Codes are assigned by both the administrative coordinator and the communications specialist and are created/cancelled as employees arrive and leave employment with the university. The **administrative coordinator** works with the **communications specialist** in reviewing bi-annual copier reports to determine codes, which have become inactive or are being used by unassigned users. After reviewing the report, they delete inactive or misused codes, as needed. The **communications specialist** and the **administrative coordinator** work together in assessing paper jams and error codes displayed by the copier. Either of them may contact the Vendor for service calls if they are part of a maintenance contract, which covers service calls. If no maintenance contract is in place and the service call requires a fee payment, the administrative coordinator determines when/if a service call is to be made.

Facilities Management-Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keys are issued to all DWR employees, graduate students, adjunct instructors, visiting faculty, and professors of emeritus status who have offices in Lamar Hall and Somerville Hall. The **administrative coordinator** and **communications specialist** work together to maintain and keep an up-to-date inventory of keys. The communications specialist maintains the key inventory list which includes the key code, the room description, further description (if needed), the person to whom the key is issued, and a “check mark” next to any key, which has been checked out. All spare keys are kept in a lock box in the communication specialist’s office. The key to the lock box is kept in the communications specialist’s office which is locked when his/her office is not being used. Both the the **administrative coordinator** and the **communications specialist** have access to the lock box.

Inventory Audit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **communications specialist** performs the annual departmental inventory verification by comparing actual items to university records. This verification begins when the UM Property Control Officer contacts the DWR each year. The communications specialist prepares for the audit by checking the department’s in-house report and comparing the actual items within SAP (AS02). Missing items will be immediately reported to the department chair so that appropriate action can be taken. When the UM Property Control office conducts their annual audit, the final inventory report will include the **communication specialist’s** signature, the **administrative coordinator’s** signature, the department chair’s signature, and the date that the verification was performed. As a general rule, DWR employees who work with computer assignment and transfers, should email the Communications Specialist (with i.e. UM#123456 in the subject line) any time a equipment is moved from one office to another. This will provide a solid audit trail when looking for equipment, which has been assigned to a room incorrectly in SAP.

Loan Equipment Forms are prepared by the **communications specialist** prior to the removal of any university property from campus. These forms must be renewed annually and retained within the department.

Paper Products & Office Supply Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registration - DWR Courses
------------------------------

The **administrative coordinator** and **communications specialist** are the DWR contacts for students needing help registering for DWR courses. If a student has transfer credit, which has not posted; AP credit, which has not posted; or if they want to take the CLEP test to “CLEP out” of Writ 101 and/or Writ 102, the administrative coordinator or the communications specialist will assist them and keep a log of any manual conditional bookings which he/she executes on behalf of students waiting to receive credit. The administrative coordinator will follow-up with these students and advise them of their responsibilities regarding adequate documentation for fulfilling prerequisites.

Software
-----------

The **administrative coordinator** is responsible for ordering software available in the Faculty Technology Development Center by using FTDC’s online ordering system. These purchases are logged onto a shared file entitled, “LOG Software Installation” and the following information is included for each license purchased: a) Property number of machine, b) Description of machine, c) user of machine at time of installation, d) software description, e) cost, f) account number charged, g) installation date, h) installer, i) software security number (key code) if applicable. In the absence of the Administrative Coordinator, the Communications Specialist may make these online purchases. Prices offered by the FTDC are generally the lowest available. However, in some instances, software must be purchased from outside vendors. Software from online sources is generally purchased by the **administrative coordinator** using the procurement card. In his/her absence, the software may be purchased by the **communications specialist** using the procurement card.
