In Fall 2020, DWR faculty and staff will work partially or entirely remotely for the semester. This will require us to be successful remote colleagues, in addition to being successful remote teachers. This page is meant to provide some resources for staying productive and sane while we're away from campus. For remote teaching best-practices, visit our [Academic Continuity Guide.](https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/continuity/)

The DWR Remote Teaching Task Force is committed to support all DWR faculty, regardless of their teaching modality. We are encouraging all faculty and staff to use [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) to keep in touch with each other and the administrative team. We're all pretty familiar with Zoom at this point, and Teams is a lot more than just video calling. Teams has reduced the volume of email for 12-month faculty and staff who have relied on the platform this summer.

Though you can access Teams in a web browser, we recommend you [download the application](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) for your computer and mobile device. Remember to sign into Teams with your UM Office365 email address and password.

When you join the DWR Team, you'll have access to the three public channels: General, Break Room, and Remote Support. You can chat with or call anyone at UM in Teams even if they're not members of the DWR Team. The Remote Support button will connect you directly to the Remote Teaching Task Force for support requests. If you haven't joined the DWR Team already, you'll be prompted to do so.
