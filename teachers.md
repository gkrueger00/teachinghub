In the past, you submitted your class rolls to us to generate your student commonplace books. This year, you'll be using the class roll to create Reader lists of your student blogs. Many of you asked for a way to divide your students up by section in the Reader: this method will allow you to do that.

Don't do this until your students have created their own blogs and subscribed to you (so you won't have to go back and add students later). We recommend creating your reader list(s) at the end of the first week of classes.

You will not be creating separate class blogs (unless you want to). Students will add your username as a subscriber. Your username is whatever comes before the @ in your email address.

## Creating Reader Lists

Instead of pulling your class rolls from MyOleMiss, this time you'll pull them from Blackboard.

**Go to the Full Grade Center** in your Blackboard course. From the toolbar at the top of your gradebook, click "Work Offline" and select "Download."

**On the "Download Grades**" page under "Data," select "User Information Only." Leave the rest of the options the same, and click "Submit."

**On the next screen, click "Download**.**"** You can save the file to your computer or open it directly in Excel. You will see the following warning message. Click Yes:

**The spreadsheet** will show the first and last names of the students in the section and their usernames. Click and drag to select all the usernames in your class, and copy them to your clipboard (Ctrl/Cmd + C).

**Now, log in to Edblogs at [edblogs.olemiss.edu](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu)**. Go to your WordPress dashboard. You should see the Reader. Notice "My Lists" in the right sidebar.

**Click "Create New List."** You can name the list by section if you want to divide your reader by section. Or, if you want all your students combined, just name the list with the semester. Paste the usernames that you copied from the Excel spreadsheet into the box and click "Create."

**You can now click on the list from your Reader** to view only the student blogs from the named section or semester. You can manage the list by clicking the small sprocket next to its name. From the manage screen, you can add or remove student blogs or delete the list completely.![](images/7-2.png)

**You can repeat this process** for multiple sections if you keep your classes separated.
