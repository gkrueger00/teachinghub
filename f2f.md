DWR policy requires all faculty to be observed at least once per three-semester cycle (see the [Observation Policy](https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/policies/directory/ "https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/policies/directory/")). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the current cycle has been expanded to include the Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters. Covid-19 restrictions make face-to-face classroom observations unwise during the Spring 2021 semester. If, however, you would like an observation of remote or hybrid teaching during the Spring 2021 semester, please use the following procedure.

Use the request form below to ask a colleague to serve as your observer. Your observer will confirm your request and ask to be added to your online classroom space. If you use Blackboard, the observer should be added as a “Course Builder.” The observer will then “observe” your course, using the criteria below as a starting point. You might also ask the observer to join a class session on Zoom if that would be feasible/desired. Finally, set up a Zoom session with the observer to discuss the observation as well as any other pedagogical areas outside of the course space that you would like to highlight, such as communication, grading and workflow, student issues, collegiality, etc. Following the discussion, the observer will submit the completed Short Narrative form below through the Teaching Hub and you will receive a copy through email.
