## Classroom Management

- Although students are very proficient at using SnapChat and Instagram, they may not be able to submit an assignment to the correct submission box on Blackboard. It's worth spending two minutes of class to show them exactly where to submit each major assignment.
- Many international students may not know how to paraphrase appropriately but are usually aware of this weakness. Some domestic students may not know how to paraphrase either but are more prone to think that practicing this skill is a waste of time. Explaining your rationale for repeating something that students may or may not have learned in high school may increase their motivation for completing activities like this.
- Students may be vocal about their frustrations with class activities and grades during class, which is not an ideal time to have a discussion about such matters. To avoid this, consider adding a clause in your syllabus expressing that you value their thoughts/opinions/suggestions/questions about grades and activities but to come to your office if they'd like to have discussions about these topics.
- College students still use the “my dog ate my homework” excuse, but now it’s the “I left my homework in my dorm” excuse. You don't have to make an exception to accept late work for this excuse.
- There will always be one or two students who come to office hours every time you offer them. These students either want you to do everything for them or are “straight A” students who have a question about a comma.
- Have an activity/assignment or two ready to post to BB or send to a colleague in case an emergency prevents you from attending class on short notice. You could have a "back-pocket" activity/assignment for each theme or could have a few "general" back-pocket activities such as creating effective titles, practice with citations, etc.
- You probably care more about some students’ progress than they do. Try to find a balance between "hand-holding" and teaching them to be responsible.

## WRIT 102 Units

- **Analysis:** Even though students completed an analysis assignment in 100/101, some students may still think the first assignment is a summary. It's helpful to have a "summary vs. analysis" day during this unit.
- **S****ynthesis:** Spending a good bit of time looking at sample papers for the synthesis assignment is a good idea, as many students will think they understand the assignment description but may not.
- **Research:** As tempting as it may be, you can’t try to talk about every bit of a paper in a 15-minute conference.
- **Multimodal:** This assignment doesn’t have to be complicated.
- **CPB:** Ensuring that you save enough time at the end of class for CPB posts or that you begin classes with these will reinforce the value of reflection and will also lead to fewer missed posts on the CPB. Be sure that you emphasize that this is a semester-long project at the beginning of the semester.
