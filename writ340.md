## Course Description

This course introduces students to the contemporary history of and various trends within writing studies, with a particular focus on composition theories prevailing from roughly 1960 to the present. Students first examine the historical events that helped shape composition classrooms before exploring a variety of theoretical approaches to understanding and teaching writing. The course engages students in analysis, comparison and contrast, classification, reflection, and argument n a variety of assignments, including written, oral, and multimodal projects. Students conclude the semester with an argumentative exploration of their own position(s) within the theoretical fields of writing studies in terms of understanding their own writing histories and possible futures as well as a final reflection about their growth as writers and theorists of composition throughout the course.
