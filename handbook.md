## About this Guide

This guide is for first time instructors and was created in response to suggestions by former instructors. It has three primary functions.

1. **Handbook replacement.** Because WRIT 102 no longer uses a handbook, we thought this guide would be helpful to new instructors for collecting resources that they could use in the classroom.
2. **Troubleshooting guide**. The committee also drew on their experiences in the 102 classroom to pull together a troubleshooting guide about areas we noticed that our students consistently struggle with.
3. **Class management:** Because new instructors sometimes find it challenging to pace out a class meeting, we have created detailed class plans that should give you a rough idea of how long different class activities might take. These instructional guides are not mandatory; we invite you to modify any materials based on your comfort your learning goals for each class.
