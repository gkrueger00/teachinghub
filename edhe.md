The common reading book selection is used each year in EDHE 105/305 courses primarily as a framework for class discussions, projects, and writing assignments that explore social themes and/or issues from the book. EDHE 105/305 instructors use the text (with a focus on those themes and issues) to teach students how to explore their personal reactions, to understand and appreciate both the things that make them different from their peers and the things that they have in common, and to effectively and respectfully voice their own opinions and viewpoints.

Note to teachers: It is recommended that before asking your students to speak publicly or participate in projects where they may have to directly address their own health backgrounds you assign a simple writing or journal prompt asking students to describe what health and/or healthcare looks like or means to them personally. Answers from students will hopefully guide you in covering the common read material in a manner that wonâ€™t cause anxiety or other possible issues for some students.
