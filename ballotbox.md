This guide provides Department of Writing & Rhetoric (DWR) faculty members with information about the Oxford to the Ballot Box project. This guide provides:

- An overview that details the project’s rationale and partners
- General assignment ideas provided by the project advisory board
- Topics for common assignments in DWR courses
- Sample prompts and assignment sheets for various DWR courses
- Incorporating tutorials from the project coordinators
- Resources (e.g., readings, videos, films, websites, etc.)

As you design your curricula and materials for fall 2020, we hope that you consider participating in the Oxford to the Ballot Box Project by adapting an assignment or incorporating a new one that helps students address the importance of and challenges related to voting. Some of your students’ work from these assignments could be featured in online venues and events that the project advisory board is developing.

If you decide to include an assignment related to the project in your fall 2020 course(s), if you have any questions about incorporating assignments into your class, please contact [Don Unger](mailto:dunger@olemiss.edu). If you have questions about the overall project, please contact [Jon Winet](mailto:jon-winet@uiowa.edu) and [Allen Spore](mailto:allenspore@gmail.com).
