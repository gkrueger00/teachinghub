In the past, we generated student blogs in advance based on your class rolls. This process bogged down the system and led to errors. Going forward, each student will generate a blog and add the instructor as a subscriber.

Student instructions are available as a [handout](https://olemiss-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/addavis_olemiss_edu/EcTjGqOJQeFEtU15HPz-qMMBkkRq4aGb_iG2ONhUdek3jQ?e=WI5ksk) and on the [student startup page](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/getting-started/) of edblogs.olemiss.edu.
