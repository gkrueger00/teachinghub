DWR Commonplace Books make use of the [Edblogs@UM](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/) platform. Edblogs is based on WordPress, so if you’ve kept a blog before, you’ll be very familiar with the interface. This page of the guide should address any technical concerns you have with using Commonplace Books in the classroom

We are making some minor changes to the onboarding process for Commonplace Books in 2017. These changes are in response to feedback from teachers and students about the My Class plugin and the difficulties users had with losing access. **We are no longer using the My Class** **feature**. Instead, you will use the built in WordPress subscriber user role to access your student blogs. Though there are a couple of more steps in the beginning, we think you will find the process smoother overall.

You will no longer have a class blog by default. The majority of our teachers did not use their class blogs, and their presence just confused students. **If you want to have a blog for your class**, you can create one and have your students subscribe to it.
