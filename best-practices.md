This section of our guide covers all of the "nuts and bolts" of teaching writing online. As a new online teacher, you've probably already gone through the training course from the Office of Online Design and eLearning. This part of our guide is designed to supplement that training with information you need to know specifically about teaching _writing_ online.

\[expand title="The Syllabus Manual" tag="h4"\]

Create a Student Manual in addition to the traditional Syllabus. The Manual covers things like technological requirements and resources, communication and work expectations, tips for succeeding in an online environment, etc. Contact [Jane Meek](mailto:jmeek@olemiss.edu) if you have any questions about the sample syllabus manual or how to create one for your course.

\[expand title="Creating a Welcome Video for New Students" tag="h4"\]

Create a welcome page for the first week and a half with introductory video: this helps students who add the class after the first week.

Below are points to make in your welcome video:

- Introduction (Your name, course and areas of expertise)
- Educational background
- Teaching background
- What is it that you enjoy about what you do/what is the most rewarding
- How you hope the students will benefit from your classes/what you hope to leave with them
- Any other interesting things you would like to share with the students

The ideal length for your video 3.00 – 4.00 minutes.

_Sample script:_

Welcome to Writing 101

I'm pleased that you have enrolled in Writing 101. This course will be completely online. Please watch the video below for additional information and read the section below the video for information on getting started.

After you have watched the video, proceed to Step 1.

Step 1: Read the Syllabus. Be sure to read the section on Expectations carefully. Then complete Steps 2-5 below.

If you have questions about the course, please feel free to contact me. My contact information is located in the syllabus.

If you have questions about Blackboard, please contact IT Helpdesk at (662) 915-5222, [helpdesk@olemiss.edu](mailto:helpdesk@olemiss.edu), or 100 Weir Hall, University, MS 38677.

_Creating a video to welcome students_

There are a number of ways you can go about creating a welcome video. Some instructors like a “talking head” intro video, while others prefer a screen recording of the Blackboard course, or even a PowerPoint. Some things to keep in mind for your welcome video:

- Keep your video short. Anything longer than 4-5 minutes won’t get watched. 3 minutes is the sweet spot for video content.
- If you want to show your face, make sure your background is clear of any distractions. If you’re using your laptop webcam, move to a room where you can have a blank wall as your background.
- If you don’t have access to a higher-quality microphone, it is best to record your video in an extremely quiet room or office without much echo.
- If you want to create your welcome video as a screencast, make sure you are in Student Preview mode, and that your browser is running in In-Private/Incognito mode, and that all other tabs or otherwise distracting things are minimized.

Tools:

- Screencast-o-matic ([http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/](http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/)) is the best screen recording tool available for free. Be sure to export your video to YouTube and caption it.
- You can record your webcam from Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, then export to YouTube.
- PowerPoints can be exported as videos, and uploaded to Youtube.

_Instructions on embedding a video in Blackboard:_

Though Blackboard does include a YouTube “mashup” for embedding YouTube content, in our experience this is not the best way of getting your videos into your course. The mashup feature does not work for unlisted videos, and if the title of your video uses generic language, it may be impossible to find.

The embed code generated by YouTube itself is your best bet. When you select “embed” from the share options under a YouTube video, you can “Show More” to see customization options. Generally, 640x360 is a good size for videos in a Blackboard course. We recommend showing player controls and enabling privacy-enhanced mode. Once the settings match what you want to embed in your course, copy the embed code to your clipboard.

[![embedding a youTube video](images/youtube1.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/youtube1.png)

Then, go to the content area in your Blackboard course where you want to put the video. Click “Build Content” and select “Item.” In the content editor, click the “HTML” button and paste the embed code from YouTube. When you submit the item, you should see your YouTube video in the content area.

\[expand title="Office Hours" tag="h4"\]

Holding office hours virtually can be tricky. How do you provide the accessibility your students’ need, especially if you live in a different town or city? What’s the best way to help your students with assignments from afar? What do students find most comfortable and convenient for them? There are several options to make your office hours convenient for both you and your students.

Here is the Department of Writing & Rhetoric’s policy regarding office hours:

_Teachers in the W&R are expected to hold regular office hours for the purpose of supporting the teaching mission through student conferencing. All teachers in the W&R are asked to hold a minimum of one weekly office hour per section taught, but no less than two hours per week. Please submit your office hours, posted on your syllabus, electronically to Glenn Schove no later than three working days prior to the first day of classes each semester._

In order to fulfill the Department’s policy, you will need to maintain between two to four office hours per week (depending on the number of sections you teach). These are times that your students should be able to contact you to discuss their writing. Here are several options that online students tend to favor:

- Continually check email during your posted office hours (remain logged into email account). We have found that most students tend to prefer to communicate through email rather than video conferencing or by phone.
- You can provide students with a phone number to call to discuss their writing during office hours.
- You can leave a video conferencing meeting open in a specified platform, letting students know they can access it at any time during your office hours to conference.
- You can also combine several of these, or offer all of them, depending on your and your students’ preferences. For example, you can leave your email running during your office hours, and let students know they can email to ask questions, or email to request a video conference. At which time, you can send them a link to meet.

The most important thing is to let your students know that you are available to assist them with the various writing and multimodal assignments they will compose during the semester. It is also vital that you provide clear instruction as to how your office hours will work, and how students can take advantage of that time if they so choose. The best way to do this is to create an “Office Hours” tab in blackboard. When students click that tab, they should be able to read when you are available, and how they can access whatever platform you choose to use during office hours.

We have also noticed that online students tend to have very demanding schedules, where they balance work, school, and families. For this reason, we highly recommend that you remain available to meet with students by appointment. That way, if your office hours are not convenient for some students, they will know they can still meet you with at a mutually convenient time.

\[expand title="How Do I Conference with Online Students?" tag="h4"\]

_Face-to-face_: If you are currently residing in Oxford, you may elect to schedule face-to-face conferences with your online students. Many traditional students seem to like this option because they get to “see” their instructor. That said, be sure to remain flexible. In our experience, many students enroll in an online class because their schedules are hectic; therefore, you may want to offer students options for conferencing. Here are several other options for conferencing with students:

_Zoom_: Some of us currently use Zoom to conference with our students; it is a free online service that enables you to meet for forty minutes (do note that one way around this hurdle is to exit out between student meetings, and then quickly reenter your chat room). You can talk using webcams, or you can simply instigate an audio conference (an option that enables you to use your computer speakers). You can also screen share and use a chat feature with students; it provides an array of options that making conferencing easy. One such feature is that students can attend the conferences using their smartphones. To learn more about Zoom, visit this link: [https://zoom.us](https://zoom.us)

_Email_: Scheduling a time for a conference can sometimes be difficult for students enrolled in many courses, or are working full time (one example would be a student one of us taught who worked the third shift at a casino in Tunica). For these students, we tend to allow them the opportunity to email a draft with questions. You can return their draft with comments and feedback to those questions, as well as other suggestions you may have for revision. We have found that many students enrolled in an online course prefer the convenience and flexibility that this option provides. Although at first you may be apprehensive of whether this constituted a “conference,” we have found that if you encourage students to reply with further questions or concerns, that this does become a “conference.” Do note that this option does tend to be more time-consuming for the instructor.

\[expand title="Students who are MIA" tag="h4"\]

What to do with students that do not complete work, but refuse to drop the course:

In an online class, you will have students who completely disappear. They will not log in to Blackboard for weeks, and will stop completing work. Here are a few tips to help keep your students engaged in an online platform:

- Email your students on the first day of class to introduce yourself and the course. Be sure to give them specific instructions on how to begin their work for that week and navigate the course’s Blackboard shell.
- After the first week of class, check for students who failed to complete their work. Send them an email that gently reminds them that they are in an online class, that assignments are due, give them a new deadline for the missed assignments, and then ask if there is anything you can do to help them better navigate the online course.
- Another possible approach to the drop-add problem might be to make the move the first deadline for any coursework after the drop-add deadline. It’s possible to check the Registrar’s website ([http://registrar.olemiss.edu/academic-calendar-menu/](http://registrar.olemiss.edu/academic-calendar-menu/)) to verify the drop-add deadline for each semester, and schedule the first 1-2 weeks’ worth of work to accommodate this deadline.
- As a general practice, I have found it helpful to email students on Mondays to remind them of upcoming assignments that will be due that week. I always end these emails by reassuring students that I would love to answer any questions they might have. This email not only reminds them of upcoming assignments, but also lets them know that you are available to help. This makes the class feel less “virtual,” and more “real” for students.
- After each major assignment, compile a list of students that failed to submit the assignment, and then email them to remind them of the course’s late policy (if you have one). I tend to put smiley faces in my emails (a strange practice, I know) so that students know that I am not angry with them; it tends to help them understand that you are approachable for questions and concerns regarding the late policy and the assignment.

Also, please know that it is very NORMAL for some students to fail to respond to your repeated requests to complete and submit work. As long as you notify them about missed assignments, you have done your job as a supportive but challenging teacher. Ultimately, you cannot make each student submit their work for your course, but you can take comfort in knowing that you tried everything to help them succeed.

\[expand title="Academic Honesty/Plagiarism" tag="h4"\]

_Reporting Plagiarism to the Academic Discipline Committee_

There seems to be a myth that reporting a student who commits blatant plagiarism (not careless citations) to the Academic Discipline Committee somehow “ruins a student’s educational career.” This is false. The reality is that if the Committee finds the student guilty and it is the first offence, then the sanctions recommended by the Instructor are the only ones enforced—failure of the assignment and of the course. The student’s name then goes into a private database so that if the student is reported a second time, the sanctions will become more stringent. For first-time plagiarists (and contrary to the popular myth), there is nothing printed on the student’s transcript, nor sent to their parents, nor reported to future professors, nor risk of academic probation or suspension. The only consequence is the instructor’s sanction of failing the class. If the instructor fails to report a case of plagiarism to the Committee, however, and the student plagiarizes again, there is no record that the student is a serial plagiarist.

Therefore, all Instructors who determine this type of serious plagiarism, should follow the DWR policy on plagiarism here: http://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/teachers/resources/policies/ and to help initiate the case, below is a step-by-step guide. Initiating the plagiarism case is done through myOleMiss:

1. Under “Student Services,” select “Academic Discipline” [![1. Under “Student Services,” select “Academic Discipline” ](images/1-300x126.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/1.png)
2. Then, select the semester and year of the student. [![2. Then, select the semester and year of the student.](images/2-300x123.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/2.png)
3. Find the section that the student is enrolled in, and choose “Academic Discipline—Initiate” from the menu. [![3. Find the section that the student is enrolled in, and choose “Academic Discipline—Initiate” from the menu. ](images/3-300x138.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/3.png)
4. Choose the student’s name and click “Initiate Case.” [![](images/4-300x51.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/4.png)
5. Select the sanctions based on the DWR policy and your discussion with the department chair. Then, scroll down to complete this page. [![5. Select the sanctions based on the DWR policy and your discussion with the department chair. Then, scroll down to complete this page. ](images/5-300x129.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/5.png)
6. Complete this page by writing a detailed summary of the case that includes the fact that you had a conference with the student to discuss their plagiarism. Also you should almost always mark Yes to “provide relevant supporting materials” for the case, and include appropriate materials such as the following:

- a PDF of the SafeAssign report (if it shows passages plagiarized),
- a screenshot of online resources plagiarized,
- a screenshot of passages from the student’s essay that are plagiarized,
- your course Syllabus showing your Plagiarism policy,
- the essay assignment sheet [![6. Complete this page by writing a detailed summary of the case that includes the fact that you had a conference with the student to discuss their plagiarism. ](images/6-300x118.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/6.png)

Once you have completed this page, you will receive an automated email saying the case has been initiated and giving you a Case number. The student will then receive an email explaining that the case has been filed, will be reviewed, and that s/he has 14 days to file an appeal. If the student appeals, the Instructor may not even know, as usually the plagiarism is too obvious/blatant to be adequately appealed. Therefore, in most cases the Committee does not involve the Instructor any more after initiating the case. The Instructor will simply receive an email in 2-4 weeks time stating the Committee’s decision—which is almost always to uphold the sanctions suggested by the Instructor. If any more information is needed to help the Committee better understand the case, the Committee would email the Instructor, but again, usually these cases are decided quite quickly and with very little demand on the Instructor’s time.

Below are some generic content to use when emailing a student whose plagiarism is worthy of being reported:

_\--Email content when initiating a plagiarism case with the Academic Discipline Committee:_

Dear Student,

I have consulted with my department's chair about your case of plagiarism in Essay \_\_\_, and he agrees with my assessment that parts of your \_\_\_\_\_\_ essay contain instances of plagiarism. As you can see from my Plagiarism Policy in the Syllabus, my department has set the penalties for such writing as failure the paper and the course, and I am required to make a report of this to the university's Academic Discipline Committee. Do not fear that this report will damage your academic career too terribly: it will not—as long as you learn how to properly integrate research and never commit this type of plagiarism again in other classes at UM. The Committee will likely only uphold the penalties (or sanctions) that I recommend, which are failure of the paper and the course. I will not recommend anything more severe than this—not academic probation nor suspension—so do not fear the worst. The Committee keeps a private database of the names of students it finds guilty of plagiarism, but the purpose of this temporary database is only in case you plagiarize a second time. This database information is not shared anywhere else. Your parents/guardians are not informed since it will not be reported on any public record in any way.

You will be contacted in a few days by this Committee asking if you accept the sanctions or if you want to try and appeal them. Please understand that if you accept these sanctions, your work in this course will now be complete, and you will need to retake the course next semester. If you choose to appeal, you will have to present a full case to the Committee including evidence that all the ideas/writing in the paper were either your original ideas or properly cited research.

_\--Information if the student emails asking about options regarding appealing the case and whether s/he should continue completing the course work while the Committee considers the case:_

Dear Student,

You are now able to start an appeal process if you so choose, and you have 14 days for this appeal process before the Committee makes a ruling. You should have seen that Appeal option via the e-mail from the Committee. You can simply follow the instructions in that email.

As for continuing to complete course work, any student reported for plagiarism is always welcome to continue participating in the course under the theory that you have paid for the experience, even if you potentially may no longer pass the course. And you should definitely keep doing course work until the case process is completed, which is about two weeks if you appeal, or whenever you receive the Committee’s decision via e-mail. You are welcome to discuss your case with my department chair Dr. Robert Cummings whose email is cummings@olemiss.edu or 662-915-1989.

\[expand title="Adding Students After the Add Date/Waitlisted Students" tag="h4"\]

The waitlist policy for online courses is the same as traditional W&R courses. The 23-student course cap is firm, and students can only be enrolled in a course from the wait list if a spot opens up in the course. The main difference is that allowing a waitlisted student to attend your class unofficially until a spot opens up, as you might do in a f2f class, is more complicated online. Though an instructor can add students manually to a Blackboard course, if they are not on the official roll, they will be dropped from the course when Blackboard syncs with SAP overnight. So, what is the best practice for dealing with these waitlisted students? Generally, we recommend that students seek out another section. There is usually at least one open spot in an online section of each of the three courses. It’s a good idea to remind students that our courses follow standardized curricula, and that their experience in each section of a given course is likely to be similar. If there are no open sections, explain to the student the policy and share with them the syllabus and any documents, readings, or materials that you can email to them for the current week. We do not recommend enrolled waitlisted students into your Blackboard section until they are officially on the roll.

Adding students to an online course after the official Last Day to Add can be risky and should be done in consultation with the department chair. Adding students even as late as the second week comes with risks, as their orientation to the online format and organization can take several days. I find that students need the first two weeks to adapt to the course organization in Blackboard, and if they miss these, they risk feeling overwhelmed and discouraged from engaging at a high level. I contact all students who fail to post any assignment during the first or second week, and I let them know that they need to invest time not only in completing the orientation assignments but in navigating the course and getting comfortable with the format. Taking each late add request on a case-by case basis--with advice from the department chair--is important, and I also base my decisions on the quality of communications I receive from the student, any previous writing work completed (either in previous semesters or in current), and how the students responds to the several assignments that I pick for them to make up.

**Adding Students Manually to a Blackboard Course**

Blackboard and SAP/MyOleMiss sync each night. If a student is added to your roll and you want him/her to have access to the course immediately, you can add the student manually to Blackboard.

\[expand title="Course Design and Structure/Student Preview Mode" tag="h4"\]

Effective course design follows the principles of Universal Design and User-Centered Design. That means that your course design should specifically address the needs and challenges of student users. In most cases, these design principles emphasize a simple, minimalist layout and an organization for a course that is intuitive.

You may have an inclination to overwork the interface of your course by adding redundant links, putting information in multiple places, and essentially trying to anticipate every possible student path through your content. We think you should resist that temptation: minimalist interfaces that do not overwhelm users with information are key to student success in an online course.

Here are some basic recommendations you can follow to keep your course simple:

- Put all of learning content in one place, and organize it by week or unit
- Use an "About the Course" content area for syllabus content
- Put all external resources and links in one content area
- Use a numbering or naming system for your discussion forums, journals, and blogs that aligns to weeks, units, or lessons
- Don't over-explain: For example, don't use a video recording to explain something that easily fits into a paragraph of text
- Use basic formatting and styling for your text. Use CSS-styles when editing text (Heading 1, Heading 2, Subtitle, Quotation, etc) instead of hard-coded styling (bold, italic, underline). This not only makes your text more accessible, but it is cleaner and more consistent across different parts of your course. [![screen capture of diaglog box for using css-style in Bb content editor](images/Capture.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/Capture.png)

You can audit your design by putting yourself in a student’s shoes. Blackboard’s Student Preview function makes this easier than before.

### Blackboard Tutorial: Using Student Preview Mode

\[iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCrAQewg7Is?list=PLontYaReEU1tzu1T5gfiX-JQA5nBc3isN" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen\]

\[expand title="Accessibility and Universal Design" tag="h4"\]

Accessibility is a core value for the Department of Writing and Rhetoric and for the university, and it’s something that we as online writing teachers think is an essential part of our mission. We rely on the principles of universal design to govern how we make our courses accessible.

Universal design is really best demonstrated by the automatic door: an automatic door is better than a standard door because people with mobility limitations can access it. However, it is _also_ better than a standard door for everyone else: if you’re carrying boxes, for example, you would prefer an automatic door. The same principle can be applied to curb cuts, typography on signs, and the design of an online course.

There are a few things you should do to ensure that your course is accessible to everyone who may be a participant in it.

- Caption video content. Any video that you use in an online course must be closed captioned (at the very least, you must provide a transcript). Captions are a great example of universal design. Obviously they are essential for deaf or hard of hearing students, but are also useful for students who are visual learners or who may be watching your videos in a library or otherwise-quiet space. Closed captioning of videos is much less of a headache than it was just a few years ago:
    - YouTube captioning is easy and fast. You can upload a transcript and convert it to closed captions or you can transcribe the video yourself using the built-in tools. YouTube’s automatic captions are unreliable unless you have a crisp, Midwestern NPR accent. For instructions, visit the Google help pages for YouTube: [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en)
    - The University provides a captioning service free of charge to online instructors. For more information, contact the Office of Online Design and eLearning, or fill out this form: [http://elearning.olemiss.edu/captioning-service-available-for-onlinehybrid-courses-at-ole-miss/](http://elearning.olemiss.edu/captioning-service-available-for-onlinehybrid-courses-at-ole-miss/). Keep in mind that if your videos are short (as we think they should be), it would probably be faster and easier for you to caption the videos yourself.
- Try to make your video instructions as universal as possible. Basically, instead of saying “Click here” and pointing to something with the cursor, say exactly what students should click on. Even if a video is properly transcribed, “click here” does not mean anything to a student who can’t see where “here” is. Also, if a non-visually impaired student is reading the transcript because that is his/her learning style, more specific instructions would help immensely.
- Any PDFs you include in your course should be processed for screen reader accessibility. This is usually only an issue for scanned PDFs. For more information about making PDFs more accessible, visit the WebAIM guide on PDFs: [http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat](http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat)
- Be conscious of color and other style elements that may cause problems for people who may see things differently than you do. A good rule of thumb: boring, monochromatic color choices and typography are a safe bet. Don’t make your design an obstacle. For help with colors, a great tool is: [http://www.colorhexa.com/](http://www.colorhexa.com/)
- Remember that plain text is the most accessible mode of content delivery. Always ask yourself if your use of other modes is necessary or appropriate for your rhetorical purpose. For example: if you have an announcement to make, ask yourself if it makes sense to record it as a video as opposed to sending it as an email. Sometimes the answer will be “yes,” but often the simpler approach to communication is the better approach.

\[/expand\]

\[expand title="Submission File Types" tag="h4"\]

Because Blackboard only accepts certain types of files, it’s important to make students aware of these limitations and set clear guidelines for acceptable submission formats. You’ll want to include language in your syllabus about this, and it’s also a good idea to cover this issue in the syllabus quiz to reinforce this knowledge. You might also include reminders about this in your instructions when students submit major assignments. Lastly, you might consider penalizing inappropriate file submissions as late work, since they often won’t open. _Sample Syllabus Language regarding File Types_ All work for this course should be submitted in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format, as only these formats are compatible with Blackboard’s grading interface. If you use a Mac and compose files in Pages, please note that you must convert those files to one of the acceptable file formats before submitting. Work submitted with an inappropriate file extension may be penalized as late if the instructor is unable to access it. \[/expand\]

\[expand title="Using In-Line Commenting and Grading" tag="h4"\]

The in-line commenting and grading feature in the current version of Blackboard is an essential tool for online teachers. Instead of downloading student essays, marking them up in Word, and reuploading them to Blackboard, instructors can now leave comments directly on student papers inside of Blackboard, post comments, and enter grades, all from one screen. You can find Blackboard's tutorial video for online grading below. Here are some things we have learned about the in-line grading feature and how well it works in writing courses:

- Be conscious of the time-out feature. The inline editor times out after 60 minutes, so if you are in the middle of marking up a paper and you get up to do something else, make sure you click "Save Draft" and exit the in-line editor. You can come back to it later and pick up where you left off. If you leave the editor up and come back to it after an hour, any markup you attempt to add will not "stick." This can also become and issue if you have a sketchy internet connection. Your best bet: Click "Save as draft" often just to be safe. [![Save Draft feature of inline editor ](images/Capture1.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/Capture1.png)
- If you want to leave styled comments, or use video/audio comments, click the "A" underneath "Feedback to Learner." You'll have the full Blackboard content editor in a popup window.
- If you're using a laptop, you might find the work area very small. Click the expand full screen button to give yourself more room [![button to expand inline editor to full screen mode ](images/Capture3.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/Capture3.png)
- Use "Grading Notes" to leave notes to yourself about the paper. These aren't visible to the student, and can be really useful if you're going to conference with a student later.
- The grade center column for the assignment must be visible to students in order for them to see your feedback. If you want to release all your feedback at once, hide the column from student view, complete your feedback, then unhide the column.
- Students can access your feedback from two places:
    - Go back to the original assignment link where the essay was submitted. Once the feedback is released, the comments and grade will show up. Until then, the paper the student actually submitted will show up (so they can always check to make sure that their submission "went through" correctly.
    - Go to My Grades and click on the actual graded item (the drawback to this method is that they can see the grade here without actually reading the comments.

\[iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrMVXAx94Xc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen\]

- You must leave some kind of grade in order for feedback to be visible to students. This can be tricky when you're leaving feedback on drafts. The best rule of thumb here is to be consistent. If points for drafts aren't a part of your grading scheme, make sure that students know that if they see "100/100" as the grade for their draft, it just means that they submitted it and you commented on it, not that they actually received an A+.
- "Point Comments" work most consistently. Some of the other markup tools are more frustrating.

Blackboard Rubrics can be a great tool for online teachers, and can making the grading process much more efficient. Though they are very easy to use for grading, they are challenging to create, especially if you want them to work the same way as the standard W&R rubrics. In addition to the Blackboard tutorial video below, we have a few suggestions for you if you want to use Blackboard rubrics, and we have provided templates for several rubrics that you can import directly into Blackboard if you want to use them.

- There are five different types of rubrics: No points, Points, Point Range, Percent, and Percent Range. Obviously, the easiest to use is "No Points," but obviously that option doesn't calculate anything for you. In our experience "Point Range" and "Percent Range" are the best options, as they allow for more flexibility in terms of exact calculations. Otherwise, you may find it frustrating that the rubric's calculation of a grade doesn't align with the grade you had in mind.

- Make sure your students know you use rubrics, and that you are making them visible. When you apply a rubric to an assignment, you have four different display options. By default, rubrics are **not** visible to students. "After Grading" means that students cannot view the rubric until you have released grades. "Yes (Without Rubric Scores" may be the best option if you find that the rubric calculations don't always line up with what you want. That way, students can see rubric feedback, but not the exact point distribution. They see the score you enter manually only. [![Rubric display options](images/Capture5.png)](http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2015/05/Capture5.png)
- Don't leave end-comments inside the rubric. Students are less likely to look at the rubric because it's an extra click. The best place to leave feedback is in the "Feedback to Learner" box on the main in-line grading page. The "Feedback to Learner" box inside the rubric is only visible to students under certain conditions.

We have created several rubrics that you can import into Blackboard directly. Feel free to use these as they are or edit them to match what you'd like to see in a rubric. To import a rubric, just go to the Rubrics area under "Course Tools" and click "Import." You can upload the ZIP file directly (don't decompress it).

\[expand title="Self and Peer Assessment: Pros and Cons" tag="h4"\]

After using this tool with three different semesters, here are some pros and cons to consider. If you have a class where 90% of the students are participating consistently, then this is a great tool. I heard from Exit Surveys that many students felt their Peer Reviews were helpful. I do not have to read and manually score them myself. However, if you have more than about ten students who are **not** posting work on time, then this tool causes the following problems: 1) the Blackboard system has total control over the random pairing of students, so some participating students will be paired with non-participating students. You have to resolve this issue by Viewing Submissions and emailing students to try and match them with others in their situation. I had to create a Word doc with all the Evaluation questions and email it to these students so they could fill it out outside of Blackboard. This was just to make sure they got to practice giving feedback. They would still (hopefully) receive feedback IF the student assigned their Submission participated in the Evaluation. 2) This leads to the second problem: non-participating students failing to fill out the Evaluations. In the directions, I had to specify that students needed to email me if their draft received no Evaluations--then I would usually fill out the Word doc Eval myself for their draft :( 3) Also, some participating students would not give adequate feedback. Since I do not have to go through and read all the Evaluations, I would be unaware of this UNLESS a student emailed me to complain. Then I would go into the system, read the feedback, and change their score accordingly.
