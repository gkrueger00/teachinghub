Upper-division WRIT courses that are a part of the Minor in Professional Writing and/or the B.A. in Rhetoric are more specialized and less standardized than lower-division courses. Individual faculty members assert more ownership over these courses and there are often several iterations of each one. The Upper Division assignment library is designed to capture as many of these variations as possible and provide interested faculty plenty of ideas and resources if they are teaching the course for the first time.
