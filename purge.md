Because our first-year students often have different teachers for their second-semester Writing course, it's important for teachers to do some end-of-semester house keeping to ensure that students are able to join their second-semester class blogs. **The only required step is the first one,** which disassociates student blogs from your class blog. The other steps are optional based on your personal preferences.

_Please note that these guidelines do not apply to Fastrack sections._

## Removing Student Blogs

You should remove all student student blogs from your class blog. Go to your class blog's dashboard. Under the "My Class" tab, click "Student Blogs." Then, go through and check the box next to each student name (unfortunately there is no "select all" at this time). At the top of the page, select "Remove from class." On the next screen, click "continue" to confirm the removal. You will need to repeat this process until all of the student blogs are detached from your class blog.

## Removing Student Users

Even if you detach student blogs from the class blog, students will still be users of the class blog. It will remain accessible in their "My Sites," though just as a regular site as opposed to a class blog. If you don't mind former students retaining this access, you can skip this step.

To remove student users from your class blog, select the "Users" tab from the dashboard of the class blog. Select all of the student users you want to remove. Then, select "Remove" in the "Bulk Actions" menu and select apply. On the next page, confirm that you want to remove student users from the class blog.

## Hiding Old Class Blogs

If you plan to create new class blogs each semester and you don't want to see the previous semester's class blogs in your "My Sites" listing, you can hide the site from your administrative dashboard. From the dashboard, click "My Sites" from the header menu. Find the class blog you want to hide and check "Hide this blog in Admin Bar" and click "Save Changes." This will hide the old class blog from the "My Sites" menu.

We ask that you do not **delete** old class blogs. If you want your class blog archived (and inaccessible), please contact [Andrew Davis](mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu).
