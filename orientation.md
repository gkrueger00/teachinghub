![Writing and Rhetoric Opening Session: Learning to Navigate the New Terrain](images/opening-session.png)This year's DWR Opening Session will combine live meetings with asynchronous, on-demand workshops. In addition to a full faculty meeting at 9:00 on Thursday August 20, we'll have a few special-interest meetings at 10:00 and an optional social "Happy Hour" gathering at 4:00.

The "on-demand" workshops will be available the entire week starting on Monday August 17. In addition to the workshop videos themselves (hosted as Panopto videos), each session has a dedicated Teams channel for ongoing discussion and Q&A. Just follow the "Join Teams Channel" link for the session.

Even though we won't gather in person for Opening Session, feel free to visit the "Break Room" Teams channel any time during the week to say hello to your colleagues. We are encouraging everyone to try using Teams to stay in touch with DWR colleagues. The Break Room can act as a substitute for the informal, off-topic chat that usually happens before Opening Session and between individual sessions. Though there are no delicious breakfast foods this time, we hope you'll say hello anyway.
