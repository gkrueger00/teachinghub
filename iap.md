Individual instructors set specific goals and then create and follow a plan to reach them. For example, an instructor might set a goal of offering one DWR brown bag during the semester and attending two university-wide brown bags and a CETL luncheon.

Use the form below to propose an individual action plan. Your proposal should be equivalent in time and effort to attending a biweekly teaching circle meeting or community of practice.

The proposal form will generate an action plan document that will be sent to your email address. You should use this document to evaluate your action plan when completing your Faculty Activity Report.
