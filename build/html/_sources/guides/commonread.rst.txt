Using World of Wonders in the Classroom
---------------------------------------
The Common Reading Experience provides a shared intellectual experience for new members of the UM community. Through reading and considering a common book, new students engage with each other and with UM faculty in exploring issues relevant to today’s global community. The Common Reading Experience helps students understand the expectations of college-level academic work, the nature of scholarly inquiry, and the values of an academic community. The program also enriches new students’ campus experiences through co-curricular programs and events related to the book. The Common Reading Text is used in EDHE classes, Writing 100/101 classes, and other classes on campus. For more information about the Common Reading Experience visit http://umreads.olemiss.edu/.

Why does UM have a Common Reading Experience?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By reading, writing, and learning together through the shared experience of the UM Common Reading Experience, students: 
* Develop critical thinking, reading, writing, and research skills and abilities 
* Gain an emerging sense of confidence as learners, thinkers, readers, and writers 
* Develop a sense of community among peers, neighbors, and instructors 
* Develop connections among ideas, experiences, disciplines, and academic and personal goals 
* Relate the issues raised by the common book to their lives as new or returning students.  

Why was World of Wonders selected?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
World of Wonders is a collection of beautifully written and illustrated essays that invite the reader to participate in, marvel at, and reflect on the natural world.  Through its careful consideration of a variety of plants, animals, and places, the book reminds us that we are surrounded by and part of an incredible ecosystem that deserves our attention, awe, and care.  The book has been named the Barnes and Noble Book of the Year 2020 and a NPR Best Book of 2020.  It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize for Nonfiction.

How do I teach non-fiction?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Common Reading Experience provides students and teachers in all disciplines a chance to interact with a shared text. Critical analysis of texts may feel like foreign territory to some teachers; however, analysis is a skill that is useful in all areas of education and beyond and can be approached in ways with which teachers are comfortable. Writing classes use the common reading text as the basis of a major project, but work with the book in other classes does not need to be so in-depth or take up entire class periods. Try to implement short in-class discussions, homework assignments, response papers, or journal writings using the themes and prompts listed in this guide. Or ask students to examine the choices Nezhukumatahil makes as a writer (style, structure, dialect, dialogue, etc.) and how they impact us as readers. Remember that you can concentrate on a few narratives that relate specifically to the themes of your course. This resource guide should provide starting points for discussions, homework, and/or writing assignments that will challenge students. 

How do I encourage students to read?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Before assigning reading:**
* Preview World of Wonders with students. Introduce the book during class. Explain how the book will be used in the course and how it will help students meet learning outcomes. Share your own excitement about the book, perhaps describing some favorite passages, events, or people.
* Help students understand the depth of reading required. Display a passage, and model critical reading strategies such as text annotation and marginalia.

**As students read:**

* Provide focused questions for students to consider while they are reading. Ask them to respond to those questions in writing before the next class.
* Have students identify and submit a discussion topic or question via email or Blackboard after they have read an assignment but before the next class meeting. Use their topics and questions as the basis for class activities.
* Require students to keep a reading response journal in which they comment on or question the reading assignment. 
* Ask students to underline/highlight several passages from a reading assignment. In class, ask students to discuss one of their underlined/highlighted passages.

**After students have read:**

* Use class time and activities to build on, rather than summarize, the reading assignment. 
* At the start of class, assign a one-minute paper in which students identify both the most crucial part of the reading assignment and an unanswered question they have about the reading assignment.
* During the first few minutes of class, ask students to write about links between the reading assignment and the topic being discussed in class.
* Distribute one or two questions that build on the reading assignment. Use the think-pair-share protocol. Students first consider the question(s) on their own. Then they discuss the question(s) with a partner. Finally, they share their results with the class.

How do I lead a class discussion?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A good class discussion, like any part of teaching, should be structured yet open to improvisation. Following are some pointers for leading a discussion based on what students have read (or even their attendance at an event). 

**Preparation before the class meeting:**

Though you may have already read the stories, be sure to review what the students are reading for your class meeting. Make a list of what you would like your students to learn from this exercise in order of importance. 

* For instance, you might prioritize that students understand what they read. 
* Then you might select a couple of scenes or events in the book that seem important or interesting (or even puzzling – just because you are leading class discussion does not mean you need to have all the possible answers). 
* Perhaps you have selected several themes in the stories as your focus. You might choose scenes that relate to poverty, stereotypes, or the power of community.  
* You might also ask students to respond to a specific quotation or passage. 
* Jot down a few notes so you can access them easily during your class discussion.
* Annotate your own text. 

**Class time:**

* Establish respect. Class discussion is a time for exploration, and the classroom is a safe environment for students to say what they are thinking. Remind students of the first rule of the University creed: “I believe in respect for the dignity of each person.”  Be sure students are listening carefully to each speaker and taking his or her ideas seriously.
* Before discussion, ask students to reflect on a directed, yet open, question in a five- to ten-minute writing. Encourage students to keep writing throughout the allotted time even if they run out of things to say. They will surprise themselves with this unstructured writing. This writing is not a quiz with one correct answer. Ask them questions such as “What do you think is the significance of X?”; “How has X changed over time?”; “Why did X do what he or she did?” You could also ask them to do a close reading of a particular passage, perhaps even comparing it to another passage. 
* Avoid general questions such as “What did you think of the reading for today?” or “What did you find interesting?”  These are dead-end questions that will lead to short discussions. 
* To mix things up, you may also have them work together in small groups to find discussion starters or answers to your questions. 

**Other ideas and approaches:**

* Different classes have different personalities. Just make sure the environment in which students speak is a safe one, and continue to encourage discussion in different ways if something is not working. 
* Some students will direct their comments just to you. Encourage them to talk to each other. 
* If you had them write a response, invite students to share what they wrote.
* If you had them work in groups, invite representatives from each group to share what they found. 
* Encourage students to point to specifics in the text. Ask them where they see what they see. 
* Invite students to read sections out loud. 
* Be open to where the conversation takes you. Sometimes students will pick up on details that you didn’t see. 
* Try not to let the class discussion go over fifteen to twenty minutes. Students are most productive in that time frame. 
* At the end of the discussion, recap the major points made or ask students to do so. 
* Course-specific discussion prompts are included in the course-specific sections of this guide. 

How do I deal with controversial topics?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some issues in World of Wonders may spark controversy in the classroom. Issues that may generate controversy include but are not limited to cultural stereotypes, cultural identity, sexism, and racism. The Yale Center for Teaching and Learning’s Teaching Controversial Topics can help you consider different approaches to discussing these issues. 

Remember that the common read discussion should always serve your course outcomes. If a student raises an issue with which you have no expertise or are uncomfortable tackling, you might respond by explaining the topic is more suited for discussion in a different course (such as English, Sociology, or Political Science). For example, you might say, “[Controversy X] is an important issue, and it’s one that you can study in depth in [Course Y]. [Course Y] is taught by an expert in that field. For the purposes of this course, let’s keep the focus on [your course outcome Z].” Additional guidelines are below.

If a student raises a controversial issue unexpectedly, you may want to:
1.     Acknowledge the student’s remark.
2.     Acknowledge that other students may hold different views or positions.
3.     Assess your willingness to continue the discussion further.
4.     Assess other students’ willingness to continue the discussion further. 

The following guidelines may be helpful for facilitating planned discussions of controversial issues:
1.     Articulate a clear purpose for the discussion (for example, how the discussion is related to course objectives).
2.     Establish ground rules, such as listening without interrupting the speaker, questioning ideas rather than criticizing individuals, offering at least one piece of evidence to support each point made, using “I” statements rather than “you” statements.
3.     Be an active facilitator by redirecting students who are off topic or participating too actively, ensuring students are not put on the spot as spokespersons for certain groups, providing opportunities for all students to participate (orally or through writing), and being attuned to students’ emotions.
4.     Summarize the discussion at the end of class and obtain student feedback.

How do I build instruction around the stories’ themes?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The essays weave many themes: appreciation of the natural world, power of observation, definition of place, family, cultural stereotypes, cultural identification, gender stereotypes, and others.

A class focusing on the theme of nature appreciation might look like this:
Individually, students identify and write about a passage that illustrates the theme of nature appreciation. (five to seven minutes)
As a class, students discuss the passages they have chosen. (ten to fifteen minutes)
With partners, students list why appreciation of the natural world is important to individuals, communities, and the world.  (five to ten minutes)
Student pairs report their findings to the entire class. (ten to fifteen minutes)
Homework: Students write a personal appreciation of a place in nature.  It could be their backyard, a place on campus, a park where they hung out in high school, etc. After describing why the place has personal value for them, students should discuss the value of that spot to the larger community.
