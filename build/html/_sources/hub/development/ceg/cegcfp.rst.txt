2021-2022 Call for Proposals
-----------------------------
Teaching and Learning in the “New Normal”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the objectives in the DWR’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is to “Support Faculty and Staff Development and Promote Teaching Excellence.” To support continuous improvement and professional development for our faculty, the department is pleased to welcome proposals for Summer 2021 Professional Development Mini-Grants.

This year’s grants will fund teacher-to-teacher knowledge building and professional development instead of large-scale revisions to DWR courses. One of the things the pandemic highlighted is the critical roles community building and professional development play in sustaining good pedagogy and teacher growth. Despite the difficult circumstances of the last year, the few teacher-led workshops that took place had broader attendance and greater engagement than ever before. As the teaching and learning environment returns to “normal” in Fall 2021, it is important to hold on to and share what we learned.

In that spirit of sharing, we welcome grant applicants to propose workshops with accompanying resource collections that facilitate teacher-to-teacher knowledge building. These workshops would be scheduled for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 with two primary goals:

1. To start conversations and inspire discussions among colleagues about innovations in pedagogy, educational technology, and scholarship.
2. To collect and curate resources to advance collective knowledge and inspire others in the future.  
Interested faculty are invited to apply for a Course Enhancement Mini-Grant to propose a workshop or similar event to take place during the 2021-2022 academic year. Workshop topics may include (but are not limited to):

* Evaluation and discussion of a digital teaching tool
* Guided discussion of scholarship
* Demonstration of an assignment, activity, or course unit
* Presentation of ongoing research related to teaching and learning
* Introduction of a community-based project related to the work of the DWR
* Successful grant applicants will receive $400 in development funds and exclusive time and support from the DWR Instructional Designer, Andrew Davis.
