title: "Analysis"
date: "2018-10-15"
---

Paper #1 is an analysis of a single text. This can be a response paper to an author’s argument or a profile or analysis of a person, place, or thing. It should be 3-4 pages with at least a single entry on the Works Cited page and is worth 10-15% of the student’s final grade.

## Summary vs. Analysis

Students by and large are skilled at writing summaries. The main thing to look out for is students who don’t understand that patchwriting or plain old plagiarism does not make summary.

Another problem with students’ summaries is that they easily slide into analysis or argument without realizing it. Many students have a problem with identifying their own bias; to them, the way they see the world is self-evident and pure fact. This is in part a problem of audience awareness. Their summaries, then, use loaded terms or absolutes to describe what they are summarizing. Neither you nor the students can fix this by pointing it out in the comments to a paper. This is a distinction they must practice.

To begin the basics of making students see the difference, all semester I ask students two questions: What does a summary ask? and What does an analysis ask? The answers are “What?” and “How?” When you summarize, you write what the source is doing or saying. When you analyze, you write how the source is doing or saying it. After that, if the student is writing a critique as part of their analysis, they write a judgment of how well the source is doing or saying it.

Reinforce this distinction by asking students to identify those different rhetorical moves in example essays. Hand out markers and have students mark up their own or a peer’s draft, or color code an example on the board as a class.

\[expand title="MWF Schedule" tag="h4"\]\[expandsub1 title="Day 1" tag="h4"\]

### Call Roll (5 mins)

Some students might not be on your roll and others may be on the waitlist. You can print out a roll (including one with photos) on myolemiss. Ask students how to pronounce names; many will go by middle names. Ask for any students on waitlist. How you keep roll from here on out is up to you. Some people pass out a blank piece of paper which is signed as a record of their attendance in their own handwriting; others call roll everyday; some people have a question which students answer as the roll is called (this can be related to the current reading or lesson and can be a daily grade); eventually some people can take roll quickly by just looking at the class. Whatever process you come up with, decide how to deal with tardy students and do not conflate tardies with absences (unless they are very late).

If students do not show up to the first day of class and have not contacted you, you may request to have that student dropped. It’s up to you but if a waitlist student shows up, you might consider doing the drop so that student can take that place. You can request the drop by contacting Glenn Schove or Joanne Mitchell (provide student name, ID, course name and number).

### Syllabus Review (15 mins)

- contact information
- attendance policy
- textbooks
- other policies that you think are important

It’s important to review certain parts of the syllabus for students but you don’t have to go over everything. Stress to the students that the attendance policy is a department policy and cannot be changed. Any WRIT 102 class will have the same policy. I like to show them what the textbooks look like, and I often scan in the first readings because students will delay buying them because of financial aid. If you have time, you can show them how to annotate an essay by showing them yours. Highlight anything in your syllabus that is unique to you and different from your peers. Remember that you are to have a minimum of one office hour per class (but with a minimum of two hours) a week. You should also have “by appointment” because some students may have class at that time.

### [Differences between 101 and 102](http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102/handbook/challenges#differences) (5 minutes)

### Commonplace Book: First Reflection (20 minutes)

Most students will probably already be familiar with CPB if they took WRIT 100/101 at UM. However, a number will not. If you do not have a CPB yourself, you will need to have your CPB set up before this class so that you know your user name to give to students. Have all your students go to [Getting Started with Edblogs](http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/getting-started/) There, they will receive instructions for how to log in and how to add your user name so you can read their blog. We recommend that you write your username on the whiteboard. Some students will have different levels of comfort with this process, and you may have to help some of them. Go ahead and assign the first reflection while you help them. The first reflection can completed as homework for those who are behind.

#### Daily Write: What are your hopes and fears for this class?

Give guidelines to your students -- write complete sentences; write continuously for five minutes; encourage them to be specific and to point to different experiences in writing classes. This will be a useful point for them to return to when they compose their epilogue post at the end of the class. Good reflective writing takes practice and time. You will want to read these first reflections to get a sense of your students; you do not have to comment on everybody’s (but it’s a nice touch to reference some student’s point -- without naming them -- at the next class meeting; it shows them that you are engaged with their writing).

### Homework

reading from textbook; complete first reflection \[/expandsub1\]

\[expandsub1 title="Day 2"  tag="h4"\]

### Icebreaker activity: Interviews (35 minutes)

Usually I put students into pairs and tell them to interview their peer; after 5 minutes or so, they will report back to the class as a whole introducing their peer. Tell them to pair with someone they don’t already know. I tell them to be sure to ask about the student’s name, major, hometown, interesting fact, or any basic get-to-know-you questions. I usually come up with some other question related to the theme. Be sure to give students a 1-minute warning to review what they know or else they will not remember their peer’s name but remember the name of their childhood pet.

### Discussion of reading (15 minutes)

See “[Leading a Discussion.](http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102/handbook/management#discussion)"

### Assign Analysis Paper

Pass out the rubric as well.

These can be handouts that you ask them to review them for next class. Some students like to get a headstart. You can print out copies for them but at least have them on Blackboard.

### Homework:

Reading from textbook; reading response reflection to CPB

\[/expandsub1\]

\[expandsub1 title="Day 3" tag="h4"\]

### Reading Discussion(20 minutes)

### Thesis Statements Discussion (20 minutes)

Students are probably familiar with thesis statements but might have learned narrow rules about it. First, some students will want to write the three point, five paragraph essay. Explain that this is a simpler, less complex way to do a thesis statement. I like to tell students that what connects the three points is the true thesis. You can use the handout to review certain rules about thesis statements. You may change the examples on the handout, especially to fit the kind of thesis statement you want to see in the analysis papers. You can also pull thesis statements from the sample papers (reinforce this lesson on day 6 when you look at the full student sample papers). Ask students to evaluate the thesis statements.

### Analysis Paper Discussion (10 minutes)

In your discussion of the analysis paper, review the expectations of the assignment and ask for any questions. You might consider asking if they have experience with writing analyses. If they took WRIT 100/101, they wrote such a paper. You can then ask them about their experiences there and what advice they have for the class.

### Homework

Students are to find something to analyze (according to the assignment); read handout on academic voice \[/expandsub1\]

\[expandsub1 title="Day 4" tag="h4"\]

### [Netiquette](https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102/handbook/management#netiquette) (5 minutes)

### Summary vs. analysis (25 minutes)

Include a discussion of academic tone.

### In-class writing (15 minutes)

Or responding to a reading assignment, or whatever you feel is necessary at this point.

### Weekly Write (5 minutes)

What are your concerns about this paper?

### Homework
